<PRE>Over the last 4 months we've averaged &#163;54.26 less coming in than going
out.

We started the company with a bit of a buffer and some events and
irregular donations have helped to cover that shortfall, but at the
current trend that will run out in February.

If the space is to continue to exist past then we need to take in more
money. We need that &#163;54.26/month to cover regular expenses, but we
also have annual expenses - the biggest of which is our accountant -
that average out to around &#163;50/month. So we really need to take in (a
little more than) another &#163;100/month for the space to be sustainable.

If you're on the fence about joining: can we tempt you off?

If you are a member but haven't always paid every month: could you? A
standing order makes this easy and reliable.

If you're already paying dues every month: could you pay a bit more?
We've 14 members who've paid dues in the last 3 months; an average of
&#163;7.45/month more each and we'd be about breaking even.

Can you offer a one off donation to extend the buffer a bit more?

Can you bring any new people along to the space?

Do you know any groups that might have some overlap with people who'd
be interested in the space where you could let them know we exist and
invite them along?

I'm also interested to discuss what ideas you have to bring in more
money. If you don't want to be a member of the space as it is: what
changes in the space would change your mind? What do you think we
could be doing differently to appeal to a wider audience?
