It's Tuesday, and as a reminder on this evening's plans I'm forwarding the below message to the announce list so y'all see it.

Bring your good ideas, thinking caps and offers of hard work, we've got things to do!

Hello Everyone.


As you may all be aware, we are Moving! For have agreed to a new location under Engage Gaming on North Silver Street.

And thus we have a lot of work to do, I want to commandeer a part of our open day tomorrow, to the organisation of the fitting out of new space. I'll be assigning some tasks to whoever is willing and organising the work to be carried out.


As an agenda for tomorrow, (Please have a think over this and consider where you may be able to help)

1. Current Overview of move.
2. Leaving Union Street:
    a. Empty
    b. Clean
    c. Fill and repair
3. Engage Space:
    a. Empty
    b. Clean
    c. Design (Walls, Insulation, Paint )
    d. Benches and shelving (Benches, shelving, tool and part locations)
    e. Electrical (Consumer Unit, Conduit, Running cables, Terminating)
    f. Ventilation (Ducting, Fan)
    g. Networking
    h. Miscellaneous


# Timescale (Very Rough Partial)

ASAP:

* People to take on some of the task areas above.
* What people have that they think would be useful for the jobs above, parts or experience.
* Costings for work to do, I am looking for people versed at procurement to give a hand, and will ask on Tuesday.
* Man hours required for the work to be done.
* possible design for the interior of the space to make it look kewl!

End of May:

* all of 2 must be done
* 3, We should have a, b, c &amp; d for the lower floor, although only as much as we can get done, and it may not be finished,
* 3.e, We should at least have a source of power in the lower floor this would be useful for fit out.


That is as much as I want you to think about, please come tomorrow for a more active openday and if you cannot make it please reply to this thread with your contribution.


Doc.
