<PRE>Dear Glorious Space Folk

You will have no doubt seen the email traffic regarding our move from
the old ThirdFloor location to lovely new digs below Engage gaming.
The new space is shaping up nicely [1] but there is still a bit of
finishing needed at the old location to make good.  The majority of
kit has been moved and the remaining kit that isn't staying is mostly
being stacked at the window end [2].

We are hoping Tuesday hackers will be able to attend the ThirdFloor
address this eve to help us finish the remaining tasks. These include:

 - Final misc kit boxing and the wrapping of wood in tarp(s) for transport
 - Carrying boxes down the steps to the ground floor holding area
   at the foot of the stairs
 - Moving boxes from the ground floor into the parked van
 - Unpacking van at the new space (1 person to assist the driver)
 - Cleaning the old space surfaces

With the usual Tuesday attendance - we will be done in no time :)

All member boxes will remain at the old space location until the 29th
May when they will collectively be transported over. There is a large
pile of kit that will be trashed next Tuesday so please check the
labelled pile for any items you would like keeping - there might be
some gems in there! If rescued kit is too big to fit in your box,
contact Nordin to arrange transport over. There is still desk space in
the old space and internet, should members need either this evening.

Lastly and somewhat unrelated, deciding to sign up to this list stood
as your giving consent for us to contact you via the @lists.57north.co
