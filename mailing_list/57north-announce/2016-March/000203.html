<PRE>Hello Hackers

Today is Tuesday, which means you get to visit the hacklab and review the
week's annoyances with your hacker buds. You've clearly been looking
forward to it.

If you are working on any super secret projects this eve that probably
won't change the world, blurt it out here anyway.

I'll be in to research/run some experiments with tiny coils. I would also
like to hear more off-the-wall opinions on the proposed space move from the
membership, if they feel like talking.  We don't *have* to shine the
uberbright desk light in your face if you don't fancy it.

Cheers,
Ed
