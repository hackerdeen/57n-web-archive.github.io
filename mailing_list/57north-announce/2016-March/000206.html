<PRE>Today is again Tuesday so the space will be open this evening to anyone
who wants to come in past. Should definitely be open by 19:00, possibly
earlier if people are there earlier.

As usual shoot something to -discuss if you have plans for the evening
that you want to share. 

I will be along (though it'll be a bit later than normal). Planning to
do some poking at things for the video wall, see if I can't figure out
what bits are still missing. Also I have a google cardboard thing to
make a VR headset from a phone that I will bring in if anyone wants to
have a play with it.
