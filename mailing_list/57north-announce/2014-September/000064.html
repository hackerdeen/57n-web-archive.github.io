<PRE>Dear all

A few things to mention:

I tidied, vacuumed and mopped the space last night - please do all you can
to make this last.  Cleanlyness is next to god-mode'lyness as the saying
goes. Also, drink goes in the mouth!

I also rotated the vortex of doom, or at least I intended to. Whether it is
part of the intended design or not, I decided to snap a repreve pic of the
items that I'll be throwing out on Sat [0].  If you see anything you want,
please put it into your box (or ask another member to do it for you).

Also, there are some official 57north beermats stacked out on the desk for
all members to take [1].  These may or may not be old 57n badge PCB
designs. We might be spraying these with the official 57n Coat of Arms
artwork [2] on request at some point, so grab them and get in line now is
my advice to you.

Also worthy of note is the 'Makeit-Glo' fundraiser workshop taking place
over in Meston building this Sunday.  It is running over 2 sessions 10-1
and 2-5. The event is fully booked, so if you can turn up and assist it
would be very much appricated. See the last run's wiki page [3] for
details, specifically the simple preset instuctions [4]. Please mail me if
you can come and support for either/both sessions. I'll be testing the
design in the space on Sat morning if anyone is down.

Lastly, a problem has developed with the space toilet relating to it's damp
flooring. Until this is checked and the situation remedied, we are
redirecting all to use the toilet on the floor below. Directions to this
are on our space toilet door.

Cheers,

Ed (aka Nordin)
Director and Treasurer,
