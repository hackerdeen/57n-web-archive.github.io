I have now set up the election with the following candidates:

Edward Watson (nordin)
Cameron Turner (Shell)
Tom Jones (adventureloop)
Carl Anderson (noodle)
Dave Hibberd (hibby)
Robert McWilliam (ormiret)
Andrea Faulds (ajf) 

We will elect 5 of them via Meek STV.

All current members of 57North should get an email with a link to vote
around when voting opens at midnight UTC tonight. If you don't please
get in touch and I can have a look at why. 

Voting will close at 23:59 UTC on the 4th of October (but please vote
well ahead of that or technical difficulties might stop your vote
getting in on time). If every vote is cast before then I think I can
stop the election and get the results early. A link to results should go
out to everyone with a vote shortly after voting closes.

Robert
