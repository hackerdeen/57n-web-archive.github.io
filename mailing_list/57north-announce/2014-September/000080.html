<PRE>Hello Hackers,

Once again, no matter how hard I try it is Tuesday. Every Tuesday 57North
Hacklab opens it doors to anyone that wants to come a long and see what we do.
Most Tuesdays there are members working on projects, talking about cool things
in the news and chewing the fat in general.

Any member coming in tonight with a plan should reply to this on -discuss and
let everybody know what you are getting up to.

Tonight we have two things happening.

1.  Calum will be instigating a 'junk sale'. Members can offer up things they no
    longer need or are taking too much space, for sale. Things can be sold
    either for the space's benefit or for the owner to make a little money. 

    Either way anything taken in tonight for sale **HAS** to be taken back out
    or place in a box. DON&quot;T ADD TO THE MESS MOUNTAIN.

2.  [Derecho] will be continuing the Tuesday talks with a quick 10 minutes
    about his yaggi and what we got up to on Sunday. I think he will be planning
    to start at 8.
