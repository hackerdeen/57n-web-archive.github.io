<PRE>In an effort to raise some ever-needed funds for the space, I thought I
would propose something a little bit different for this week's Open Tuesday
- a tech auction.

The idea is simply that everyone brings along at least one broadly
tech-related item which they're willing to put up for auction, with all
proceeds going to the space.

Suitable items might include:

 * Tools or materials
 * Useful / interesting / collectable hardware
 * Project 'leftovers'
 * Games, DVDs, books
 * Mobile phones
 * Camera equipment
 * Corporate gifts
 * Conference freebies
 * Drunken ebay / kickstarter purchases

The only rule would be that if something doesn't sell, you have to take it
home with you again (rule 4: no dumping), or donate it to the 'vortex of
doom' if it's small enough.

Why not have a rake through your pile of techno kipple (don't deny it - you
have one) this weekend to see if you have something you would be happy to
donate?

Cheers,
Calum
