I'd like to throw my hat in the ring. 

With the number of candidates creeping up on 5 it looks like we might
get past there and have enough to have an election (yay, I like
elections (especially ones with complicated rules and maths)) so you
also get my pitch...

I'd like to improve communication around decision making. For example at
the recent EGM there were a few things put on the agenda by the board
where I don't think the thinking behind the proposals was adequately
explained. 

In my ideal world no board decision would ever take anybody by surprise
as there would have been much communication about the why and wherefore
of the proposal before any decision was taken.

Robert
