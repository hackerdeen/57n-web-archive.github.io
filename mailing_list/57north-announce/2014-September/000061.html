<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>At the EGM on Saturday we decided to run the election of directors
differently to the way we have done it previously in the hopes of
opening this up to participation from folks who couldn't make it along
to the meeting (either to stand or to vote). 

The procedure will be that those willing/wanting to stand as a candidate
to be a director should indicate that by sending an email to 
<A HREF="http://lists.57north.co/listinfo/57north-announce">57north-announce at lists.57north.co</A> announcing that they are standing and
giving an explanation of why. 

The deadline to declare candidacy will be 0:00 Saturday 27th September.
Assuming we get enough candidates[1], I will then create an election on
opavote.org on Saturday and voting will open 0:00 Sunday 27th September
remaining open for a week and closing 0:00 Sunday 5th October. We agreed
at the EGM to use STV but didn't specify a variant, my preference would
be for Meek but as chair of the meeting the decision falls to Carl[2].
All times are going to be in UTC because timezones are a pain. 

Everyone who is a member on Saturday 27th will get a vote - there is an
intention to finalise details of the ongoing dismemberment of those who
are too far behind on paying so that their membership ends before then. 
You will receive an email from opavote with a link you can use to vote.
To vote you put the candidates on the ballot in the order of your
preference. There will be more detailed 

When done opavote will produce results similar to:
<A HREF="https://london.hackspace.org.uk/organisation/elections/2013-election-results.html">https://london.hackspace.org.uk/organisation/elections/2013-election-results.html</A>

Then on 5th October we'll have a shiny new collection of directors. 

Robert

[1] If we don't then the existing board will still be in office and we
will need to have some discussions about what the space can/should be
going forward... which I'm sure would be fun.

[2] Any other details I've specified here that aren't in the minutes for
the EGM are also subject to approval from Carl.
