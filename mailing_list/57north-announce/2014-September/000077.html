<PRE>I would like to indicate my intention _not_ to stand as a candidate in the
forthcoming election. While I'm happy to have filled the post on a
temporary basis, other commitments mean that it's not something I'm in a
position to devote a significant amount of time to on a regular basis. As
they say, it's better to do something whole-assed, than two things half-
assed.

It is still my intention to play an active part in the space, though as an
ordinary member.

I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the outgoing board for
their hard work over the previous year, and congratulate them on putting in
place the foundations on which the new board can build.

Cheers,
Calum
