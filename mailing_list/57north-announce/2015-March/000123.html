The 31st Chaos Communication Congress

CCC happens in the last week of December each year, for the 31st congress a
group from 57North headed over to Hamburg Germany. The congress is a four day
event held in the Hamburg Convention Center, it attracts hackers, makers,
artists and renegade cooks. The convention center is covered with art projects,
informatics and a working pneumatic tube system. Somewhere in the center there
is a 22 hour a day night club.

What follows are some stories from the 57North members that visited Congress at
the end of last year.

A New Dawn

<A HREF="https://github.com/imatix/zguide/raw/master/images/fig1.png">https://github.com/imatix/zguide/raw/master/images/fig1.png</A>

Consider the Above image. If you want to understand one thing about the yearly
CCC Congress was that the participants did not use enough bandwidth. So hoy do
you a fill a convention centre with ~12000 hackers and not use enough
bandwidth. You may think it would be because the uplink was set up by hackers
and therefore quite optimistic, but you would be wrong the main reason was that
when you get so many of these people in one space strange things happen.

I have attended 3 of these and 2 camps and each time the experience has been
different. This time on the first day I cooked some soup from a traditional
Shetland recipe in the food hacking area, this was a prescient decision,
because the it was one of the most welcoming and friendly areas of the
conference, where some of the more memorable moments were had. Overall the
conferences have been getting darker and more oppressive, with last years
abandoning it's traditional tag line, because the intelligence service
revelations had left a large proportion of the attendees distinctly speechless.

But this year we had 'A New Dawn', a tag line that was meant to end the
rumination of the previous years events and a call to look towards the future.
A future where there are over ~ 12,000 people from all around the world
gathered together to for a shared experience centered around our relationship
with modern technologies, and how they effect out lives. So I spent the first
day cooking an ancient Shetland mutton dish.

I suppose the question is what have we lost? We have become dependent on these
advanced technologies, which are largely beyond the rationale of the majority
of the population, but in this convention centre we have a large number of
people to understand these things intimately. I believe what we, as a society,
have lost the control over our environment, it has grown largely beyond our
understanding and what little we do grasp is obfuscated, warped &amp; spun to the
point of meaninglessness which makes it near impossible to get a firm base of
understanding on which to build. Will all our new technologies which we take
such pride in solve this problem?  That really depends on our relationship to
it, if we treat it as something we passively interact with which gives us
answers but in which we have no control over the operation it all may as well
be magic. Magic is something we must be inherently distrustful of.

Back to my original question of why we didn't use enough bandwidth? We were all
too busy interacting with our environment, because of this we couldn't sustain
that level of interaction and process large quantities of information, we
simply don't need it, or want it. Is this such a strange thing to happen?
Probably not. Was it optimistic for the organisers to think we would use so
much? What is optimistic about that, maybe the quantity of data isn't something
that should be strived for, maybe we should be more focused on demystifying
this our architecture, not building more of it.

To Quote Arthur C. Clarke -

Plate-lickingly Good

Over the 4 days of the 31C3 event, the Hamburg Congress Center was transformed
into an essential mecca for hackering aficionados, and a holy shrine it was
indeed. 

From my approach, the building was excitably large and in a stroke of genius,
the org had hacked the giant CCH sign of the center to show &quot;CCC&quot; with LED
strips and black bin liners in a manner that just would not be allowed at the
UKs NEC.  The floor area our table was in was one of the darker areas intended
to allow hacker-built lighting projects to shine in their glory.  Around us
hung a sm&#246;rg&#229;sbord of lit globes, chaser lights and fire effects. I had brought
along an ATtiny-powered 80-led light strip of makeit:glow fame that, while
pathetic in scale, still stood proud on our adopted table. The light preset was
fixed to 'drunk, fabulous cyclon' which I felt added a particular foamy joy to
the ambience.

Framing the action inside were large vacuum tubing installations dotted either
side of a starship-themed central lobby corridor. Occasional dance beats could
be heard out-thumping the assorted pockets of vocal babbling as people entered
and existed the beautifully hacked-up dance club bolted to the side of the
entrance lobby spaces.

Also, there were talks.

I am not going to describe the talks, awesome though they were, as they were
all recorded and can be viewed at media.ccc.de. For me, 31C3 was all about the
workshops and one workshop area impressed more than the rest. The Food Hacking
Base (FHB) [1] collective are a bunch of hackers from all over the world who
share the love of experimenting with food and beverages. They have a very
inclusive mindset and openly invited anyone interested in their sport to take
part in food themed workshops. I found myself taking part in a lot of these
over the event, learning many things whilst dropping grateful donations.

From the Whiskey aficionados, I learnt that I prefer my whiskeys smoky to
peaty. I think that smoky aroma simulates that comforting experience of
smelling the Friday-night bonfire on a shitty work Monday via the same
scent-impregnated scarf. In terms of cheese tasting revelations, I learnt
Lavender cheese can be quite cheeky and soggy German brie'ish cheese (sorry no
name either) to be plate-lickingly good.

Of particular pleasure was the Makgeolli, a rich runny-yogurt-like beer(?)
native to Korea and fermented using nuruk, a dry a wide clod of many microbes.
I learnt that the resulting microbial orgy creates such a high CO2 release that
when opening the bottle, the entire contents generally ejects out in your face.
Double bowls are needed to prevent messy disappointments on de-corking.  

There was lots home-brew with people explaining their creations around the
table.  Ranging from nettle wine, ciders of different ages, working-mens beers
and prison hooch, the latter served complete with zip bag, straw and bucket. I
really wish I had taken notes about the labels I drank, as it happened I got
progressively jolly and made friends instead. Good call. After experiencing the
cheese tasting, some of us stayed to prep the next session with the remaining
cheeses. After the work shopping was done, I found the whiskey I'd forgotten
earlier and joined others with their left over stashes.  We had an follow-up
evening of ad hoc hacked-up dining with leftover bread, meat, cheese and
spirits. I *think* it was thereabouts when decided I wanted to make some viking
(i.e. wild) mead, and I got a lot of roaring drunken advice about wild
fermentation, which seemed very topic appropriate.

On reflection months on, the real magic at the FHB and the 313C event in
general comes not from the stuff but the staff - the people that organise to
spread the joy of their hobby.  Certainly those running the food area gave a
HUGE amount of their time to the attending hackers and I for one really
appreciated their efforts. In the FHB, people can just rock up and help, which
I did where I could.  Certainly I encourage anyone in the vicinity of a future
FHB event to offer their help - you will have a great time! Certainly I shall
be pledging ahead for CCC camp and if the above sounds yum, I recommend you do
the same. 

Props to FHB members Frantisek Apfelbeck, Lotte Smelik and Marcel van der Peijl
for their general food hacking awesomeness.

This ship is better

Much to my mother's annoyance, I hopped on a plane to Germany on Boxing Day to
head to the Chaos Communication Congress. I wasn't really sure what to expect
as I hadn't done vast quantities of research on it, unlike my comrades.

Upon arriving at the conference centre, I was surprised by the scale of the
event. Labyrinthine floors and rooms, partially populated by nerds of all
varieties. After an initial walk around, and set up at our table, it was time
to drink Club Mate, meet people and enjoy the atmosphere. As the week
progressed, the half empty rooms became full rooms. There were people
everywhere - the best part of 10000 hackers, I believe.

The list of things I saw and marvelled at is too long and boring to itemise, so
I shall summarise some of what I learned about how to survive at Congress over
and above having an encrypted hard drive and a tinfoil hat. 

While the event is thought to be very infosec based, it had an incredibly
diverse range of activities and talks always happening - Foodhacking Base, for
example, or the 3D printers area as another.  People are there to show off what
they're excited about, and are more than willing to talk to you about it until
you know everything there is to know. For me, this is where the real value and
excitement of the Congress is - free share of knowledge (and whisky). 

Participation in Congress takes many, many forms and is very personal.  All the
talks are streamed, so you don't have to leave your home base to see them. Some
people go to play Capture the Flag, some people go to set up and demonstrate
new things. Some people go to see every talk they can. Others might just like
to quietly sit and enjoy everything happening around them. How I chose to spend
my time was different from how others did, but no less valid. Once I got over
the concern that I wasn't using my time as well as someone else as I wasn't at
a certain talk, I had a lot more fun.  

One of the highlights for me was the nightclub. It was a total surprise, and
fantastically well put together, considering it was a temporary installation.
Many long hours were spent in there!

I came away from Congress inspired and excited by human creativity. Give people
tools and we will build awesome things. If we don't have the tools, we'll build
them first. I'm already excited for camp in summer and Congress next year. It
doesn't matter if you're not a pro hacker who used to phreak and can
regurgitate years of the Telecom Informer - if you go to Congress with an open
mind, you'll learn, discover and be driven to do better.

If nothing else, it's definitely better than the internet spaceship conference.

The Local GPG Web-of-Trust

The ability to trust that the person you are communicating with over the
Internet is the person you think they are is important. You wouldn't want to
give your private details to a website impersonating your bank, nor would you
want to download malicious software from a person impersonating a friendly
FLOSS project.

On the Web, HTTPS is becoming more common on websites, and this
provides a method of verifying, using a trusted third-party, that the person is
who they claim to be. Your browser contains a list of trusted certificates from
&quot;Certificate Authorities&quot; and these authorities will sign the certificates of
others after having validated their identity. These authorities can also sign
other authorities certificates and then you can trust the certificates signed
by that authority too by following the trust chain back to the certificate you
have in your browser.

By having these central authorities, the whole system can break down if the
central authority is compromised. You only have their word to go on and you'll
find that if you look in your browser, there are quite a few certificates in
there from companies you've never heard of (not to mention the certificates
that those companies have signed that you will then trust to sign other
certificates) and this process is meant to be enough for you to hand over
private information or download software to run on your machine.

The model used in HTTPS is a &quot;chain&quot;. This chain is limiting for the reason
that it requires these central authorities. GPG however, uses a &quot;web-of-trust&quot;.
This web allows for you to have multiple paths through which to trust a
certificate, which means that trust can be more personal. You may trust a
friend's certificate that may trust the certificate you're looking to verify,
you may even have multiple friends which all trust the validity of a single
certificate, allowing you to have a stronger level of trust and removing the
single point of failure.

I visited 31C3 over the new year, and attended a key signing party there. This
is where people get together to improve the trust on their keys and to help
others increase the trust on their keys. In order to validate the person's
identity before signing their key, at GPG Keysigning parties, it is common
practice to check some form of government issued ID. This may be a passport,
identity card or driving license.

For everyone at the key signing party, this seemed to be accepted and no one
appeared to acknowledge, if they did it was not openly, what was really
happening. Our web-of-trust was merely an abstraction of the HTTPS-style trust
chain. We had returned control of trust back to central authorities, in this
case governments, and reintroduced a single point of failure.

In the past, this may have been necessary. GPG has been instrumental to the
success of open-source projects in allowing for, amongst other things,
verifying code base integrity and for the secure submission of vulnerabilities
before public disclosure. There were not however many people using GPG in your
local area and the best way to get trust in your key was to visit a key signing
party where the likelihood is that you did not know many of the people there.
Government issued ID was the quickest and easiest way to establish trust in the
identity of the person stood before you.

Since the revelations from Snowden, and with the increase in the availability
and usability of front ends for working with GPG, there are now more GPG users
around and some of them are going to be local to you. You may even know them
already. It is now possible to have strong trust in keys through people that
can tell you the identity is correct, not just because they saw a government
ID, but because they have known the person for years.

Hackerspaces seem like a good place to start, and so I have put together a
website for the 57North Hacklab Web-Of-Trust [2]. You'll be able to see
here members of the 57North community that use GPG, and the trust links between
these keys. If you'd like to have your key added to this graph, send an email
to &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.57north.co/listinfo/57north-announce">irl at fsfe.org</A>&gt; and your key will be added. It's up to you to get the trust
links though.

I will be running a key signing party [3] on the 19th March 2015 at 7:30pm at
57North Hacklab. I'd like to see this grow further, which is why I am organising
this event and also inviting the Aberdeen University Computing Science Society
and Edinburgh Hacklab along to attend. For details on how to get involved, see
the announcement of this event on the mailing list.

Getting the space weather 

I drove my small car in an after-work dash to a quite low cliff side car park
in-between the harbour lighthouses. There I sat intently listening to radio
static blasting from my mac. A freshman radio enthusiast, I was planning to
receive magic space images from orbit via my magnetic roof antenna plugged into
a cheap SDR radio receiver. The long, drawn sputnik-sounding 'weep weep' with
superimposed donkey-like short 'clip clop' of the NOAA Automatic Picture
Transmission (APT) signal was my pay dirt. After its capture, the audio signal
was going to be processed via a simple tool chain to become a beautiful,
fully-formed live weather photo from orbit. This exciting outcome was not a
given however, as I had found at my last two attempts. I was pretty sure this
run would be a success and not a waste of hours. I had brought sandwiches and a
banana just in case.

I'd heard about the magic NOAA weather broadcasts from Hackerspace radio folk
and it seemed like a fun way to use the RTL-SDR and Sky Scanner Rx antenna
combo I'd bought on a whim. A number of weeks ago, space members hosted a radio
weekend at Aberdeen Uni where folks erected their roof dipoles and made
contacts over HF. Making use of the roof also, I played with receiving the NOAA
signals, sprinting to the chilly roof when the sats passed overhead. Orbiting
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) satellites circle
pole-to-pole 540 miles above the earth. NOAA have a few sats up there and the
three main APT players - NOAA15, NOAA18 and NOAA19 - pass overhead a few times
a day. NOAA15 and 18 have their downlinks as 137.6200MHz and 137.9125MHz
respectively and seem to be the strongest signals for me.

To track sat passover times, I found gpredict [4] to be a great open source
tool that can be installed cross-platform.  To capture the actual audio via an
RTL-SDR once I had a sat overhead, I used GQRX [5] for the mac set to narrow
FM, but SDR# does a great job on a windows machine. On the mac, outgoing audio
can be directed to an input device via the virtual soundflower device and
recorded via Audacity set to a sample rate of 11025hz. On a non-mac, you&#8217;ll
probably have a &#8216;stereo-mix&#8217; device in place already.  The resulting WAV file
then needs to be imported into the very cool WxtoImg tool. It does a one-click
job of automatically transforming the audio into imagery, even if the signal is
incomplete. This was the audio [6] and resulting image [7] of my first attempt.
Not great, but a good start. At 38secs the audio is perfect, but it does not
last. I sought a clearer, more rural sky, so a few weeks later I drove to the
harbour coastal car parks and took a shot there, but the cloudy day seemed to
prevent a strong signal.  I got the &#8216;weeps&#8217; but not the&#8216;clops&#8217; :(

So back to the present: there I was in my third attempt, waiting in my little
car in a car park with worlds smallest entry gate (seriously, my Corsa barely
fitted past). After waiting a spell, I started to hear shadows of that magic
sound.  I had run my mac battery down by this point and I did not want it to
die at this crucial stage.  I plugged in my car charger for more juice.  Not
long after, I COMPLETELY lost the signal. Having not started the audio capture
I was pretty pissed when no tweaking about the freq made any change. The sat
was still in full view but I was getting nothing with 3 mins till LOS. In fact
the entire noise floor had risen up (that should have been a clue). I checked
the usb/coax connectors and roof aerial but no change. The sat passed below the
horizon just as I realised that I had started the car engine to make sure my
charging laptop and phone would not kill my car battery. Stopping the car
brought the noise floor back to normal. DAMIT DAMIT!! Thats how I learnt that
using cheap radios from inside a car sometimes work better with the engine and
chargers off. Feel free to write that down if you are a radio dumb ass like me.
On the plus, I guess I forever learnt something new about SDR radio and found a
nice radio spot, so not a waste of hours at all.

If *you* want to have the same (or hopefully more successful) raw
audio-to-imagery experience, you should hurry. The APT sats are getting pretty
old and cannot hold orbit forever. NOAA APT transmissions are scheduled to die
from 2017 [8] and will be replaced with something digital.  Boo hiss boo.  If
you do have a go though, for gods sake make sure you bring sandwiches. It seams
brains are optional.
