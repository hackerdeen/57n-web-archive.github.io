<PRE>Hello Hackers,

We have a quarterly Newsletter at 57North, the aim is to publicise member
projects and summarise goings on in the Hackerspace. 

Without articles from members the newsletter is just an account of membership
and events that have been run in the space. To make the newsletter as good as
possible it is essential that members submit articles and stories.

So, if you have been working on something cool or have gone on a Hackerspace
related adventure, I implore you to write up an article. It only has to be a
few hundred words and of interest to the members of the hackerspace.

There are only a few stipulations:

    1.  The article MUST not have been published anywhere before.
            - After the newsletter has been released you are of course free to
              do what you want with your own article.
    2.  Articles MUST be submitted by the deadline.

Anything else goes, chances are if you are interested other members will be
too.

The deadline for articles is the 10th of March and they should be submitted
directly to the Editor&lt;<A HREF="http://lists.57north.co/listinfo/57north-announce">editor at 57north.co</A>&gt;. If you wish to securely(or
anonymously) submit articles they should be encrypted to Tom&lt;<A HREF="http://lists.57north.co/listinfo/57north-announce">jones at sdf.org</A>&gt;.
