<PRE>Good Evening Hackers! 

Find below the minutes of meeting for the last Directors meeting, as
approved by the directors for public release. Sorry about the timing, I
meant to send these sooner, but they got put to the back of my brain
under the pressure of all the serious business I do on a daily basis!

We'd appreciate it if you would have a look at the below and pass comment on
what we discussed. 

It's really important to remember the space belongs to all of us, and
that the management and processes involved are open to debate,
discussion and scrutiny. If you disagree with anything that the
directors decide, send us a message telling us what you think and why
it's better. You can message me privately, and you can message all the
directors privately at:

<A HREF="http://lists.57north.co/listinfo/57north-announce">57north-ctte-private at lists.57north.co</A> 

You can also message publically in reply here or on 

<A HREF="http://lists.57north.co/listinfo/57north-announce">57north-ctte at lists.57north.co</A>

Much Love

Hibby
