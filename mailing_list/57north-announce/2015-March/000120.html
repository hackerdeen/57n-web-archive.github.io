<PRE>Hello Hackers,

Once again it is Tuesday, 57north's weekly open night. Anyone is welcome to
come a long and see what we get up to. Normally there is some hacking on
projects, drinking of beer and wondering which existential crisis will hit
this week.

If you are planning on coming in tonight, you should reply to this email on
-discuss and let everyone else know. If you are working on or trying to start a
group project, or just doing something cool, this is a good place to ask for
help or to show off your cool idea.

Newsletter: We have a quarterly newsletter and deadline time is approaching. If

            an article.  Please submit articles to the
            Editor(<A HREF="http://lists.57north.co/listinfo/57north-announce">editor at 57north.co</A>)
