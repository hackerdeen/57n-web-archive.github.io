<PRE>Hello Hackers,

It is the first Tuesday of the New Year, what a brilliant time for an open
night? Come down to the space and see what we get up to, there is normally
hacking, drinking of tea and questioning the value of the goblinicity scale.

If you are coming in please reply to this email. Iain will be discussing the
plans for a new wiki and the cool cats that went to 31C3 will still be going on
and on about it.
