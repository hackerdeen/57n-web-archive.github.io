<PRE>It is again Tuesday so we have our open evening today.

The new space is getting close to being usable as a space to do things
other than just work on the space, though there is still plenty of
stuff to do on the building out the space front. We are likely to be
discussing that and making more plans this evening.

We got a cable run for the internet connection last week. When I
checked over the weekend we had a working internet connection at the
router but it wasn't working from things connected to the router. I
wasn't able to figure out why in the few minutes I had to poke at it
before I had to be elsewhere. I'll take another look at getting the
router to route properly today. I may be looking for help with
that...

Other stuff on my TODO list would be hooking up doorbot and looking at
getting tools/components/stuff unpacked and organised so we can do
stuff without lengthy hunts through boxes, plus probably drinking some
beer. 

What are your plans for the evening?

Robert
