<PRE>Time has rolled on and it is again Tuesday, so we have our open
evening today.

Anyone is welcome to come along and have a look at the new space, and
help make plans for the rest of the fit out. We might even get to
actually doing some it this evening.

I'd really like to sync up the various plans people have for future
work and get them written down this evening so we can get input (and
help doing the work) from the wider group.

Top of my list of priorities is getting doorbot wired up and getting
the cable run to take internet connection down from Engage.

I think I should be in from about 18:30 so access will be available
from the door on Skene Terrace after that (or is anyone going to be in
to open it earlier?).

Robert
