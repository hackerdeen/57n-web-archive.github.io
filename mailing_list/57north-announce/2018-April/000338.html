<PRE>Dear all

Following an email sent on April 3rd to the discuss list (see below),
we can confirm a second basement viewing at 'Engage gaming' has been
arranged for 6pm Tues 17th Apr, next week. This visit is for anyone
affiliated with the space who wishes to view a potential new space
location that we have been investigating.

It is suggested that we assemble in the Engage gaming floor, near the
bar. The address is: 26 North Silver Street, Aberdeen, AB10 1RL. Once
we start the viewing, there are a number of flights of stairs to get
down to the target basement floor; however, more accessible entry down
only 1 flight from a basement street entrance can be arranged.

For those arriving via car, the nearby Denburn carpark has plenty of
spaces and pretty cheap rates. There is also dedicated disabled
parking across from the basement's street entrance.

The other space-related events also scheduled during that evening (i.e
open night and keysigning) will take place from our usual Union Street
address.

Kind regards,
Treasuring Co-director Nordin

Dear Members

The directors were notified of a potential new space location just off
Skene Terrace, underneath 'Engage gaming' [1], a local business
providing PC/console gaming facilities - basically gaming hardware,
desks, soft seating and a bar. We visited the location last week and
have composed a short review of the main points for discussion with
the membership.

The Skene Terrace entrance [2] - which would be our lockable point of
entry - overlooks the Union Terrace/Rosemount Viaduct junction and
across that, the library. The street entrance leads to a wide
stairwell landing, between two flights. Going up a flight takes you to
a toilet/shower area and a few further flights up take you to the
Engage gaming floor. Going down a single flight takes you to the
basement entrance. Inside and ahead of the basement entrance is a 2m
by 5m (approx) irregularly-shaped room with section of glass bricks as
a vent/window to the upper-left. Inside and to the right of the
basement entrance, a short 3m x 1.5m (approx) corridor connects to a
5.5m x 3m (approx) main room with one far stone wall, the rest
plaster-boarded.

Points discussed with the business owner:
 - Rent: £300 / mnth inc. reasonable* Internet, water and reasonable*
electric use
 - Would be a sublease, we can have paperwork to suit our needs (From
rolling to N mth lease)
 - Business owner renews his 12month lease in July (early July we think)
 - We can redecorate
 - We can add our own street door lock for out-of-hours access
 - We can add power/data lines as needed
 - We can occupy early before renting for the move/decoration
 - There is less-secure understair storage between street door and
basement door, and a little
    more on the toilet/shower floor two flights up
 - local parking free from 8pm, paid parking at Denburn and streetside.

* = Internet can be metered but electric is not metered for basement at present.

Points discussed after visit by those present in the hacklab:
 - Seems viable in terms of space and cost
 - Would need to mitigate possible forced move risks (business might
move address etc) with
   some plan Bs
 - If viable, a lease start date from July after a June fitting/moving
might work.
 - Current space would need a fixup if we want deposit back

Directors are planning to visit a second time and will notify members
when a date is confirmed so members have an opportunity to view the
area also. We are currently aiming for April 17th.

Regards,
The 57North Board of Directors
