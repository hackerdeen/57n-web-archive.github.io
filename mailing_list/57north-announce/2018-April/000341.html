<PRE>Hello Everyone 

It is Tuesday, our weekly open day, and do we have a treat for you, in reverence to the stranglehold bureaucracy has over our society will have been given no other choice then to inflict on ourself the barbarity that is an Annual General Meeting, so I encourage all lovers of bureaucracy to attend. I have included more information about this wondrous occasion at the end of this email, for all those who fell asleep when with was first sent out.

To prepare yourself, you may want to digest -&gt; <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a00nQryEoW8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a00nQryEoW8</A>

After this one in a year time event, we will head to the nuts and bolts of the space and get hacking, I'll probably be working on the Fine Dust Sensors and if i get bored with that then the roof pc.

Will you be in and what will you be working on?

----------------------

# AGM etails from Previous Email
 
Much of the procedure for the AGM (and other things about how we operate as a company) are laid out in the Space Corp. Directives (see clause 4) which can be obtained from Companies House or (if you trust me that they're going to match the official Space Corp. Directives [0]):
<A HREF="https://github.com/hackerdeen/articles/raw/master/hacklab_articles.pdf">https://github.com/hackerdeen/articles/raw/master/hacklab_articles.pdf</A>

Our current membership count is 20, a quarter of 20 is 5 which is equal to the 5 max needed for quorum under directive 44, so quorum will definitely be 5 members.

The AGM is intended to be a check that we are sticking to our legal requirements rather than going through the day to day running of the space (issues about the day to day running would be better raised on the discuss mailing list).

This year we are also using the AGM as an opportunity to have a discussion about the future of the space.

Agenda for the meeting:

* Election of meeting chair
* Report on activities since last AGM
* Treasurer's report
* Future Plans for 57N
* Election of directors
* Any Other Competent Business

Any issues you'd like to have raised at the meeting can be sent to <A HREF="http://lists.57north.co/listinfo/57north-announce">57north-discuss at lists.57north.co</A> or privately to any of the directors or to the directors collectively at <A HREF="http://lists.57north.co/listinfo/57north-announce">57north-ctte-private at lists.57north.co</A> (please make it clear you are sending something you want raised at the AGM) and we will see that it is brought up.

A proxy can be appointed to vote on your behalf at the meeting (see Space Corp. Directives 47, 53 and 54). If you would like to appoint a proxy please send an email to <A HREF="http://lists.57north.co/listinfo/57north-announce">57north-ctte-private at lists.57north.co</A>

Email sent to the 57north-ctte-private address is redirected to all presently listed directors and is not archived by 57North Hacklab (but may be by the individual directors). 

The email (preferably PGP signed, with a key trusted by the directors to be yours) should contain:

 - Your name and address
   (as it appears in the register of members (hackhub))

 - Who you would like to appoint as a proxy

 - That this is for the AGM on 24th April 2018

 - If you have any specifications for how the proxy is to act on your
   behalf.

The proxy should bring the same details to the meeting on paper and signed by the member they are to act as a proxy for.

Remote participation in our meetings is allowed, if anyone who can't make it to the meeting would like to participate remotely I can set up a conference call and/or google hangout for the meeting. Any members who would like to connect via one of these channels should let me know; I will not set this up unless demand for it is communicated to me.

If anyone has a different preference for how they would like to participate remotely: let us know and we'll see what can be done.

[0] The PDF of the articles that I think is the accurate version (what I last submitted to Companies House for changing them) has SHA256 checksum:

57North Hacklab Ltd. is a company registered in Scotland (No. SC470230).
57North and 57North Hacklab are trading names of 57North Hacklab Ltd.
