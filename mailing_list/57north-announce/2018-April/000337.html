<PRE>TL;DR:
doorbot is dead.
You can't get into the space via hub right now.
If you want into the space talk to a keyholder.
The whiteboard currently lists the keyholders as DocOcassi and Hibby

The long version:
The PC part of doorbot [0] looks like it might have breathed its last
this evening. I'm going to take it home and have a see if at least the
data is recoverable (our backups leave a bit to be desired...), but it
is making horrible noises so I'm not holding out much hope.

We tried to put another machine in in place of the doorbot PC but the
byzantine nature of the space network sucked a couple of hours of
effort without managing to get the new computer to speak to anything
down the doorbot network cable, or managing to route traffic to
anything on the internet network.

We will try and get something back in place to restore doorbot
functionality as soon as possible, but there isn't really an ETA on
that.

For now if you want in you need to coordinate with someone who has
keys. The whiteboard currently lists the keyholders as DocOcassi and
Hibby.

[0] which is not the part of doorbot I bodged together on a corner of
protoboard and left floating on the end of a cable near the floor that
most people who saw it complained about
