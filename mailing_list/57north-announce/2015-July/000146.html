<PRE>Hello Hackers,

Again it is Tuesday, 57North's weekly open night. The space will be open
tonight to members and anyone else that wants to come down and see what we get
up to.

If you are planning to head in fire off a reply to this and let the other
occupants of the list know. This is a perfect time to brag about the cool
projects you are working on.

With today definitely being Tuesday, tomorrow will probably be Wednesday. If
tomorrow is Wednesday, then it will be time again for TechMeetUP. This month we
will have James Littlejohn talking about ethereum.org.
