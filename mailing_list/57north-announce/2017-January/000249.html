<PRE>It's a shiney new year but the hackspace Tuesday procedure remains the
same. We'll be open for anyone to come visit this evening.

We might have some more Christmas presents to open if we can sort out
actually getting them to the space (volunteers to help move them
should talk to Tom).

If you have plans to be along, and/or what you'll be working on let us
know on -discuss.

I think I'll be prodding at the blinkenlights that didn't work at
33C3, and possibly the videowall that didn't work at Edinburgh Maker
Fayre...

Robert
