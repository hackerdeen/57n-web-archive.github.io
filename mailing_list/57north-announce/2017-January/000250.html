<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>Today is open Tuesday at 57N and all are invited to come along after
7pm!

For those of you not in the know, Tuesday evenings are open to anyone
who wishes to come to 57North, Aberdeen's hackerspace! We get up to a
range of activities on Tuesday nights, including but not limited to
social contact, programming, manufacturing weird things and consuming
sugary treats. 
We begin usually at about 7, but sometimes someone will be in earlier. 

It is advised you bring a laptop, and perhaps a project you want to work
on.

If you're coming in, feel free to reply and tell us all what you're
working on.

I'll probably be doing some debian packaging. If not, I'll be thinking
about data radios and accessing the university. 

See you there!

Hx
