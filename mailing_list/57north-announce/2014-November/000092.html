<PRE>This weeks Themed Thursday will be an evening looking at various things
to cause or sense movement. 

We will have some motors, servos and steppers (at least one of each) and
example control systems to have a play with (and hopefully people who
understand them to have a chat with). 

On the sensing side we have accelerometers and some ideas around making
potentiometers from conductive ink. 

There was talk a while ago of building a communication system that pulls
on string for its physical layer. This talk might continue and perhaps
even get as far as some action. 

Bring along anything you have to make or sense movement (anyone got a
collection of solenoids? Some hydraulic or pneumatic rams? Does anybody
know what they're doing with the mechanical side of things?
<A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkQ2pXkYjRM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkQ2pXkYjRM</A>), or movement related
problems or hair brained schemes.

I won't be around next Thursday (13th). Any volunteers to run something?
The organising can be as simple as committing to being there and
announcing a topic you're interested in (or as complicated as you like). 

Robert
