<PRE>Goooooooooooood Morning Hackers!

Before your regular tuesday email, I've got an interruption to add!

We've organised an Open Street Map weekend at the space on Sat 22nd and
Sun 23rd of November. 

What does this mean?

OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a user editable map of the world, released with
an open content license. In the same way that wikipedia is a free, user
generated collection of all human knowledge, OSM strives to be a user
free, generated collection of all human environments.

To assist with the collection of this information, there's different ways
to get involved - submitting GPS traces of where you've been, using
JOSM[1] to directly edit information or adding shops and amenities using
your browser are just three of a multitude of things that go on. 

If you've not seen it, have a browse of Aberdeen! 
<A HREF="http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=13/57.1433/-2.0963">http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=13/57.1433/-2.0963</A>

We're having a weekend of activities in the hackerspace to both collect
data as a group, making Aberdeen more accessible and to  work on cool
ways to use that data!

What's happening at this weekend?

Day 1 will be a mapping Party.

A mapping party offers you the opportunity to learn how to map your
local area using the tools commonly used by OSM editors, the chance to
explore aberdeen a bit more and the opportunity to discuss and learn
what things are valuable to have on an online map.

Day 2 will be a Mapping Hackday. 

The mapping hackday will offer you the chance to go over uses for OSM
data and work on uses for it - you could be using the maps in a website
you're working on, or finding ways of integrating it into apps you use
regularly. 

You'll get to learn how other people use the mapping data too, to
inspire your playtime!

When is it?

It runs from 12:00 on Saturday, 22nd November to 15:00 on Sunday, 23rd
November. This lets people get up from down South, as well as us get out
of bed / go to radio club!

What do I need to bring?

The most basic items will be yourself, some sort of waterproof clothing
just in case it rains, a computer to play with and maybe some lunch
money - I'm not feeding you! (There will be coffee/tea/biscuits,
though...)

I want to come and/or learn more!

Cool - there's a rough schedule and list of attendees on the OSM Wiki
[2] - stick your nose in, stick your name down, and come have a good
time. Feel free to come to one or both days, or just to the pub on
Saturday night - there'll be walkies, discussions, socialising, hacking,
people from far away and new faces abound!

Any questions, ping me a mail or reply to the list!
