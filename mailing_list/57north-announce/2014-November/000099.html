<PRE>Hi,

I just can't maintain hackr as it currently is. The FreeBSD packages are
terrible and about on the same level of quality as AUR packages. I plan to
migrate hackr to Debian.

Your home directories will be migrated along with your user accounts. If you
currently use SSH key-based authentication, this will continue to work. If
you use password authentication you will need to ask me for a password reset
after the migration is complete.

I plan to begin the migration at approximately 10pm tonight and it will be
complete by tomorrow morning. If you require hackr during this time, let me
know and I can delay the migration.

You will need to restart any services (tmux sessions, znc sessions, etc)
after the migration is complete.

As I'll know what I'm doing with Debian, there will likely be new services
on offer and these will be detailed after the migration is complete.

I would have given more warning for this, but hackr is currently in an
unstable state after the attempted installation of MySQL which went quite
horribly wrong. Apologies for any inconvinience caused.

If any software you want is missing after the migration, please let me know
and I'll install it for you. The installed package list on Debian will be
maintained in a git repository, so you can request packages by pull request
(or by email if you're not comfortable with git).

Thanks,
Iain.
