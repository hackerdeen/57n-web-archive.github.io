<PRE>Hi All,

The migration of hackr from FreeBSD to Debian has been successful. The
following services have been restored:

  * Mail forwarding
  * DNS
  * Web server
    * Planet
    * User web sites
  * APRS&lt;-&gt;XMPP gateway
  * Hackercat

Some changes have been made to the configuration of some of these services.

The DNS service is now provided by BIND9 instead of knot. DNSSEC is still
being investigated.

The web server will now redirect to https (with a self-signed certificate)
although does not currently implement HTTP STS.

User web sites can now have PHP dynamic content.

A MySQL server has also been configured, and users can have access to this
by sending me a request.

If a service you had previously used is now broken, let me know and I'll
look at fixing it.

Thanks,
Iain.
