<PRE>Hi all!

It's Tuesday (barely, but by the time you read this it'll be more Tuesday).
Following a brief test on Friday, I think we should spice things up tonight.

Let's try workadventure![1] 
Some may be familiar with this as the way &quot;RC3&quot; ran this year.

It's a little 16 bit browser based adventure with inbuilt Jitsi! Hopefully this'll make audio setup/etc easier.
I've spent some time fiddling with irl's already excellent map - we have two rooms to occupy and some toys to play with.

Each of the rooms has a Jitsi meeting and standing in the marked areas (there are a few, if they're in the same room they're linked) will join you into that room's Jitsi. 
If you stand close to someone or a couple of folks outside the marked areas, it'll spawn a separate call with you both in it, so you can wander away from the rest of the group for a chat. 
If anyone's really struggling, there are also direct Jitsi links to each room that I can give out. 

Come join us here:

 (I know it's a long scary link... I don't yet know how to fix that, and as you can see, most of it is github).

Get in and have a little explore - once you've had a look around, it will probably be obvious where I am!

If we choose to use this more, it's dead easy to update the map via the secret ScotCon git[2].
In case anyone autopilots to mumble, I'll hang around there to catch&amp;redirect you... probably!
