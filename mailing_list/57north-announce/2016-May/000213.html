<PRE>A bit later in the day than we usually aim for for this[0] but it is
Tuesday. This means we have our open evening this evening. The space
will be open from some time before 19:00 to late(r) for anyone who wants
to come and visit to do so. 

I'll be along to put a new fan in doorbot and see if we can get it's
temp down a bit from the  92&#176;C it's currently at. Anybody else have any
plans? Or excuses for not sending this reminder earlier?

Robert

[0]  my excuse: I was on holiday yesterday so can't quite convince
myself this isn't Monday
