<PRE>We've rolled around into another week and Tuesday has again arrived, so
this evening the space will be open to any and all who want to come
along.

If you're planning to come in reply to -discuss to let folks know that
you'll be there and what plans you've got.

I'm planning to get some more of the changes needed in hackhub to move
it to its new home done (or more likely drink beer and glower at the
code wondering which idiot thought that was a sane way to do things). 

This week also has TechMeetup tomorrow, with Tony talking  about the
Parallella:

&quot;Hi-Ho Silver Lining...

Parallella is a credit-card size SBC (Single Board Computer) inspired by
the RPi (Raspberry Pi) that was crowd-funded through a successful
'Kickstarter' project by its manufactuer Adapteva. Like the RPi it has
an ARM (Advanced RISC Machines) processor on board, but the ARM on
Parallella is there to provide a host environment to control a MIMD
(Multiple Instruction, Multiple Data) array of mesh-connected 'Epiphany'
CPU's using a Zynq FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array). The main
objective of the Parallella project is to democratise access to parallel
computers and encourage the development of grass-roots support for open
hardware and software to do parallel computing in a similar way that the
RPi has done for conventional (serial) computing: The Parallella project
aims to make parallel computing accessible to everyone. It has sometimes
been a controversial project, a victim of its own hype, but over 10,000
Parallella boards have been shipped and the project may well succeed in
its main objective.&quot;
