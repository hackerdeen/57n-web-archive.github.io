<PRE>Happy Tuesday everyone!

Today is open Tuesday at 57N and all are invited to come along after 7pm!

For those of you not in the know, Tuesday evenings are open to anyone
who wishes to come to 57North, Aberdeen's finest hackerspace.

We get up to a range of activities on Tuesday nights, including but
not limited to social contact, programming, manufacturing weird things
and consuming sugary treats. We usually begin at about 7, If you're
new, I'd suggest you bring a laptop, and perhaps a project you want to
work on.

If you're coming in, feel free to reply and tell us all what you're
planning to do! I'll be having a tidy and writing some unflattering
python code.

** Big Mayfest thanks! ***

Big thanks for those who helped organise, run and/or popped over
during the Mayfest 'Hall of Mayhem' event on Sunday. One of the event
organisers remarked how busy our tables looked with an impressive
spread of ages - which is good to hear.

Special props to those who brought over top-up surprise (to me)
projects - we had a great spread of stuff going on.


** Tuesday Trumpets Playlist **

Today I have been mostly listening to a trumpet-renditions of modern music:
