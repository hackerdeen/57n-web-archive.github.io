<PRE>Dear all

As news to me at least, last night one member reported that when they
login to the 57north.org.uk website site via the 'Member's login'
link, the resulting redirect occasionally takes the user to
id.57north.org.uk or 'id' for short (that white page that lets you
change password, access services etc.) rather than direct to
57north.org.uk/hub - 'hub' for short, where they can open the door.

Having dug a little, we are not sure why some users login to hub and
others login to id (mine goes straight to hub always), but members can
still access hub from id by clicking on 'More services' -&gt;
<A HREF="https://hub.57north.org.uk/hub/login/ticket">https://hub.57north.org.uk/hub/login/ticket</A> link. The unlock info on
the wiki's member induction page [1] will always get to the unlock
door page also. Again, we are not sure what conditions lead to this
and no changes have taken place that should cause it. Any theories are
welcome.

Any member caught outside who cannot trigger the door for any reason
will still have access to the our upper floor level (where there is
heat, power, WC and seating) via Engaged. Just ask to be let in from
the Engaged floor. They have the right to refuse you access if they
don't know you as a 57N member, so it's a good reason to introduce
yourself as member to the Engaged staff early. If they cannot confirm
your membership and you have no other place to wait, I will ask that
they still allow you to hang on their floor short-term until the space
door can be opened for you.

Cheers,
Treasuring Bureaucrat Nordin.
