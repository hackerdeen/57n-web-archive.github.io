<PRE>Hi all, sorry for the late announcement.

The Space will be open from 7pm at the space on Skene Terrace[1].

If you've not heard of us, we get up to a range of activities on
Tuesday nights, including but not limited to social contact,
programming, manufacturing weird things and consuming sugary treats.
We usually begin at about 7, but sometimes someone will be in earlier.

We're located downstairs from Engage Gaming. Access is through our
door just beside the Assembly on Skene Terrace! If you're unsure about
anything, ask in IRC[1]. If you're new, I'd suggest you bring a
laptop, and perhaps a project you want to work on. If you're coming
in, feel free to reply and tell us all what you're planning to do!

I'll be in from 8 as I have to pack for my next work trip's early
start tomorrow. Has anyone thought of inventing a combo VR headset +
travel pillow? I feel I would use a combo VR headset + travel pillow.

See you there!

Cheers,
Nordin
