<PRE>Hi all,

This evening is our weekly open night. The Space will be open from 7pm
at the space on Skene Terrace[1]. We usually begin at about 7, but
sometimes someone will be in earlier. We're located downstairs from
Engage Gaming. Access is through our door just beside the Assembly on
Skene Terrace! If you're unsure about anything, ask in IRC[1].

If you're new, I'd suggest you bring a laptop, and perhaps a project
you want to work on. If you're coming in, feel free to reply and tell
us all what you're planning to do!

There are a whole bunch of events going on this week, From techmeetup
tomorrow to a night of dancing later in the week. 

REMINDERS:

Lastly, do check the trashing page on the wiki [3]. It lists items we
intend to trash unclaimed items in the next few days if unclaimed. If
you have claimed something, now is the time to collect it.
