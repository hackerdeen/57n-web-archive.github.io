<PRE>This is rather late at this point, but anyway: it's Tuesday. That means
the space will be open for members and visitors this evening. There
should definitely be people around by 19:00. 

I'd normally ask anyone to reply to -discuss saying if they'll be along
and what plans they've got, but I'm not sure there's much point at this
stage. Feel free to ignore me though and raise a virtual hand if you're
coming.
