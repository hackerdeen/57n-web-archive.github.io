<PRE>Greetings Travellers! I am Falconhoof, and I shall be your guide for 
today.

I see we have a caller on line one - it is you!

Caller - You have found yourself at an important junction in time and 
space:
It is that most important of days, Open Tuesday at your local 
Hackerspace, and you happen to be nearby. What a coincidence!

Do you:

a) Email the mailing list to confirm your attendance and say what you 
intend to spend time doing, and then attend the event.
b) Send no email, however turn up anyway and enjoy your evening
c) Send no email and stay at home, fruitlessly wishing that better 
weather would come.

Remember, this is your adventure and only you can shape it. What will be 
your choice, caller?
