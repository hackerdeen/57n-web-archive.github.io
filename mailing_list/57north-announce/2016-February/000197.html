<PRE>All,

'Tis Tuesday, that day most hallowed by hackers in Aiberdeen for the 
hackerspace is open for all, members or no.

We'll be there from 7ish, some members of our cohort will inevitably 
arrive earlier.

If you do intend to come in, message the list and tell us what you're 
doing. Equally, feel free to ask for more information if you're confused 
as to why you'd want to come in.

I shall be eating curry and swearing about stuff most probably.

Love and hugs,

Hibby x
</PRE>
