<PRE>It's Tuesday. For anyone having trouble with keeping track of such
things this is your weekly reminder that time is passing.

As usual for Tuesdays the space will be open this evening for anyone who
wants to come along. Let us know on -discuss if you're coming and have
plans for what you'll be doing.

But this isn't any old Tuesday: it's pancake day. We have in the past
tried to make pancakes in the space. Anyone fancy another try this year?
There are extra hackspace points for the most convoluted approach
(though you get marked down for any violations of rule 0).
