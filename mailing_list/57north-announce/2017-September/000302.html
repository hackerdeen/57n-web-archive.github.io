<PRE>Morning nerds!

It's a fine foggy day in Aberdeen, and open Tuesday has rolled around
just like our beloved Haar.

For those of you not in the know, Tuesday evenings are open to anyone
who wishes to come to 57North, Aberdeen's hackerspace[1]! We get up to a
range of activities on Tuesday nights, including but not limited to
social contact, programming, manufacturing weird things and consuming
sugary treats.

We usually begin at about 7, but sometimes someone will be in earlier. 
If you're unsure, ask in IRC[2]! 
]
If you're new, I'd suggest you bring a laptop, and perhaps a project you
want to work on.

If you're coming in, feel free to reply and tell us all what you're
planning to do!

I shall be continuing my &quot;learning sockets in python&quot; project, which is
going nicely. 
I shall be appearing at 6, fiddling for a while and then going for food.
You are welcome to join!

Hx
