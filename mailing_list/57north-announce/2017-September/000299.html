It was pointed out on Tuesday that the change of plans only went to
-discuss so we didn't tell those of you that are only here on
-announce. Sorry about that.

Anyway since the plans changed the celebration of the space having
neither burned down or gone bust for a whole 4 years is now happening
this Saturday 16th. I'm aiming to get to the space about 15:00, from
others I've heard &quot;afternoon&quot; and &quot;5ish&quot;...
