<PRE>I've recently been looking at CNC router things and there are some on
ebay that are cheap enough to be really tempting. One with a working
area of 300*180*45mm comes in at about £200.

<A HREF="http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/EU-Stock-3018-Mini-DIY-Laser-CNC-Router-Engraving-Milling-Machine-Desktop-Kit/272843871719">http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/EU-Stock-3018-Mini-DIY-Laser-CNC-Router-Engraving-Milling-Machine-Desktop-Kit/272843871719</A>

Or if we want to order from outside the EU and take the chance on
import charges we could get one with a little more stuff for about the
same money.

<A HREF="http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/3-Axis-USB-DIY-CNC-3018-Mill-Wood-Router-Kit-Engraver-PCB-Milling-Machine-ER11/112545845996">http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/3-Axis-USB-DIY-CNC-3018-Mill-Wood-Router-Kit-Engraver-PCB-Milling-Machine-ER11/112545845996</A>

Smaller machines don't seem to be much cheaper, but the price does
seem to take a big jump for anything bigger. 300*400mm looks to be
about £400. 

These things can also be made into a (hideously unsafe) laser
engraver/cutter by adding a diode laser in place of the spindle.

The included spindle motor should be good enough for soft materials
(wood, plastics or the like) and there is the possibility of upgrading
to a more powerful motor to cut metals or other harder things.

I think it would be &quot;useful&quot; for things like cutting foam to turn into
aluminium, milling out face plates for project boxes and putting holes
in PCBs (or for big enough features even milling the traces). 

Anyone else think this is a good idea? Or know of better options to
add a CNC mill to the space?

I think I'll put £50 towards one (and might be convinced to add a bit
more if we get close).

I can only please one person per day. Today is not your day. Tomorrow
isn't looking good either.
