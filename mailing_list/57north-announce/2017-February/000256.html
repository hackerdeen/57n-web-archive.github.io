<PRE>Today is open Tuesday at 57N and all are invited to come along at or
after 7pm!

For those of you not in the know, Tuesday evenings are open to anyone
who wishes to come to 57North, Aberdeen's hackerspace! 
We get up to a range of activities on Tuesday nights, including but not
limited to social contact, programming, manufacturing weird things and
consuming sugary treats. 
We usually begin at about 7, but sometimes someone will be in earlier. 
If you're unsure, ask in IRC!

If you're new, I'd suggest you bring a laptop, and perhaps a project you
want to work on.

If you're coming in, feel free to reply and tell us all what you're
planning to do.

I shall possibly be doing some radio, yammering on about shitty clients
and having a think about puzzleboxes, Debian and why the closing
monologue from the Great Dictator [1] is still culturally relevant.

Ta

Hibby &lt;3
