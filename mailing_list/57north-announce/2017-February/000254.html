<PRE>Today is open Tuesday at 57N and all are invited to come along after
7pm!

For those of you not in the know, Tuesday evenings are open to anyone
who wishes to come to 57North, Aberdeen's hackerspace! We get up to a
range of activities on Tuesday nights, including but not limited to
social contact, programming, manufacturing weird things and consuming
sugary treats. 
We usually begin at about 7, but sometimes someone will be in earlier. 
If you're unsure, ask in IRC!

If you're new, I'd suggest you bring a laptop, and perhaps a project you
want to work on.

If you're coming in, feel free to reply and tell us all what you're
planning to do.

I'm going to look at the Weather station we got from our friends on the 
continent and see what I need to buy to make it a complete unit. Once
it's
done I'll need to find somewhere sensible to site it!

After I'm doing being a consumer, I'll talk loudly and continue trying
to work 
out QT designer / QT Creator, QT5, PYQT and seeing if I can remember
C++.

Hooray!

Hx
