<PRE>Howdy! It's Tuesday, it's 2019 and it's time to get started on new projects and exciting ideas. 

Consider coming to 57North tonight for cheer and social contact! We get up to a range of activities on Tuesday nights, including but not limited to social contact, programming, manufacturing weird things and consuming sugary treats. We usually begin at about 7, but sometimes someone will be in earlier. 
We're still settling in to our new location, downstairs from Engage Gaming. Access is through our door just beside the Assembly on Skene Terrace! If you're unsure about anything, ask in IRC[1]. 

If you're new, I'd suggest you bring a laptop, and perhaps a project you want to work on.

If you're coming in, feel free to reply and tell us all what you're planning to do!

I shall be in and working on code. Bit of info-beamer, bit of wifi, bit of mate, bit of beer. Usual me.
