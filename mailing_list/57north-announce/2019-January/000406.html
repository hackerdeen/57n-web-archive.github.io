<PRE>Howdy all!

It's Tuesday, it's dreich and that makes it a perfect day to come in to play with and break your favourite toys at 57N

If you've not been to 57N before, We get up to a range of activities on Tuesday nights, including but not limited to social contact, programming, manufacturing weird things and consuming sugary treats. We usually begin at about 7, but sometimes someone will be in earlier. 
We're still settling in to our new location, downstairs from Engage Gaming. Access is through our door just beside the Assembly on Skene Terrace! If you're unsure about anything, ask in IRC[1]. 

If you're new, I'd suggest you bring a laptop, and perhaps a project you want to work on.

If you're coming in, feel free to reply and tell us all what you're planning to do!

I shall be in and working on code. Bit of Debian, bit of 3D printer prodding, bit of mate, bit of beer. Usual me. 

** Note that Cryptonoise is on this Thursday, 17th January and everyone is invited [2] **
