<PRE>Hi all

On Tuesday, the board met and voted [1] to start our move to the
Kettock Lodge Bridge of Don location [2]. We plan to use October as
an overlap month, with access to both spaces whilst we move over.

Strategy
The current move strategy is to arrange for seating, tables and wifi
in the new space locations as soon as possible, arranging and
unboxing other items after. Items for trashing will be left behind and
disposed of in a separate effort.

When exactly?
To get a good start, we are arranging for the first physical kit move
to begin this Saturday (28th) using two vans, a standard Transit and
small Transit Connect, over a couple of runs. We will arrange follow-up
moving rounds after this first one as needed. Anyone who is able to
volunteer for this round should confirm via the discuss list; we'd need
people at both locations, so please email discuss if you could use a lift.

ETA for Sat volunteers at the old location is approx. 10am. ETA for Sat
volunteers at new location is 1pm, as the first van-run arrives.

If you cannot make this weekend but still like to be a part of the physical
move, we'll likely announce further moves. It is also expected that there
will be a few sorting evenings at the new location once items are moved.
Unlike over moves, we have a fair bit of open space we can use to sort
things out. We hope be able to confirm an official place-of-business
change over date after the weekend.

Coordination
Friday evening and Saturday morning have been suggested as times to
sort the space to get it ready for transport. I suggest that the
vehicle drivers
(or those they delegate to) take the lead in deciding what goes into vans
on Sat, as they'll know how much they can move at once. Beyond that,
we are looking to put as many things into labelled boxes as possible which
those attending can collaborate on. We have some folded boxes already
but if anyone has a source of strong boxes we can borrow or keep, do
email in.

Cheers,
Nordin
