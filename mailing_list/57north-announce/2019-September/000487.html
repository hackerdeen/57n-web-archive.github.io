<PRE>Hello Hackers

Another week another open day, We Are open to everyone so if you can make it down, please do, if you a have a friend who may enjoy an evening with with other talking nonsense about technology, forward the email to them.

As mentioned earlier in the week, we're having a board meeting at 7pm [1] - all members are encouraged to come, observe and contribute opinions but don't get a vote.

If you have not been along, we meet at 3 Skene Terrace (Next to The Assembly there is a white buzzer on the door) <A HREF="https://57north.org.uk/contact">https://57north.org.uk/contact</A> if you are coming bring a laptop or a project, it helps fit in, because we generally sit around our laptops.

If you do want to come by respond to the list with info about what you will be doing,

I'll be down to look at this hard drive that makes my laptop die in a confused manner. At least I've enabled sata hotswap so I can maybe put the drive in while the system is up!

Hibby
