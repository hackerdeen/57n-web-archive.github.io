<PRE>Fit like!

It's Tuesday, and that means the hackerspace is open for all to come and 
say hi.

I'm looking forward to chilling out in this mad heat, and 57North is 
totally the perfect place to do that.

Give us an email reply to tell us what you're going to come in and do - 
show off some toys, play with some toys or leave your toys in your bag 
because you're actually embarrassed about them.

If it's more your style, feel free to tweet us @57northhacklab - my ego 
needs all the engagement, retweets, hashtags and likes it can get. Plus, 
you'll make my Pebble vibrate and annoy my boss.

Much Love
Hxx
</PRE>
