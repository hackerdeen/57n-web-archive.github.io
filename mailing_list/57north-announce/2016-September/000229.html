<PRE>Through a very scientific process [1], it has been decided that this 
weekend is the Space's Official Third Birthday.

Happy Birthday 57North!

To celebrate a birthday, society dictates we must have a party! We shall 
have a party this coming Saturday to fulfil this requirement.

We've not partied in the space in quite some time, so it's looooooooong 
overdue!

The party shall also be a hackathon - let's hack improvements to the 
space to celebrate our existence as a community.
These can take any form, but suggested classes include:

&gt;<i> Important classes
</I>&gt;<i>  - 'Keep us from going bust' class
</I>&gt;<i>  - bureaucracy-as-a-service website class
</I>&gt;<i>  - a fuzzy IRC bot class  (i.e. fridge beer temp or occupancy via CO2
</I>&gt;<i> sensing etc.)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 'Un'portant classes
</I>&gt;<i>  - A fing-longer class
</I>&gt;<i>  - am-too-well-arty trophy class
</I>&gt;<i>  - 'rebel without a' class
</I>
Feel free to bring a friend and introduce them to our mad culture and 
have them hack the space with us.



Before the party kicks off, on Saturday Afternoon (often referred to to 
as Hackurday) I would like to have a space decluttering, cleaning and 
item organisation session. I'd like to try to throw some things out, 
refine and refile what we've got, maximise our usage of available space 
and clean all available surfaces properly.
We can also listen to shitty music and complain about our friends weird 
tastes and bizarre fetish for shuffle.

It'd be much easier if there were a few of us in doing this - if you're 
kinda tempted to make the space better, drop an email to the list 
please.
