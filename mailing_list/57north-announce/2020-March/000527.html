<PRE>Hi all

Today is Tuesday, which means it's our weekly open night. If you've
not heard of us, we get up to a range of activities on Tuesday nights,
including but not limited to social contact, programming,
manufacturing weird things and consuming sugary treats. We usually
begin at about 7, but sometimes someone will be in earlier. There's
plenty of parking!

NOTE I will likely not be in this evening so if you don't have key
access yourself, I recommend confirming someone plans to open up by
your eta. Instead of hackerspacing this eve, I am stuck at work
on-project until some silly hour. I'll be on IRC however.

What will you be doing?

Cheers,
Nordin
