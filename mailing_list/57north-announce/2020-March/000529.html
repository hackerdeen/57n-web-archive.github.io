Hello Everyone,

Amid the pestilence of our up comming horseman we may be having our Openday today.

I Won't be in because I will have to talk about the AirAberdeen, but if someone else will be opening please tell the list.

We welcome everyone to our space at Kettock Lodge, Bridge of Don, <A HREF="https://57north.org.uk/contact/">https://57north.org.uk/contact/</A> at 7pm, for  the experience of a Hacklab, we will be socialising, working on projects, drinking mate, and not setting off fire alarms, If you will be along, bring a project or a friend, please bring  laptop, it helps ease social anxiety.

If you will be there tell us what you will be working on.

Midder
