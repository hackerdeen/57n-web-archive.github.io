I won't be in the space tonight, or probably for the next few weeks. 

I would be happy to host a call so we can have some remote hackerspace
idle chatter if anyone is interested. Please send email if you want to
do this.

The radio folk are coordinating to do a daily net on vhf, but I am happy
to try a daily watercooler with people from the space on some other
audio medium.

If you shine for more than 4 consult your register warlock for advice.

- Tom
