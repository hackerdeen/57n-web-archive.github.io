<PRE>Hello Everyone,

As you may have seen from the previous email, we are considering the current coronavirus going forward therefore, we will not be having an openday today, If any one is interested in being there today, there may be people at the space but no guarantee.

This will be reviewed on a weekly basis, we encourage all member and non-members to stay safe and consider the vulnerable around them.

I'll be in the space for a short time from about 7 to work on some air quality stuff.

Here is a Article with a lot of info about the outbreak, which may be of interest to people.

If you are working from home and want some virtual company, we are generally on IRC #<A HREF="http://lists.57north.co/listinfo/57north-announce">57N at irc.freenode.net</A> some of our members hang around on the fediverse.

Stay Shiny

Midder
