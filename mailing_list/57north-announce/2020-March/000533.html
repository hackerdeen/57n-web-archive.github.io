<PRE>Hello Hackers,

With social distancing I can only guess that some of you , are like me
miss the occasional night of bullshitting in the hackerspace.

I thought we could do a (slightly) organised night of talking about
projects ideas, built from the things we have in our homes.

To do this we will do a voice call on Tuesday night from 2000 using the
Milliways mumble.

The plan is to go round those that appear let them say roughly what
they've got[1]. Once we have gone through everyone we can bullshit and
come up with ideas.

Following weeks (this isolation will go on for weeks), we can talk about
progress and news and stuff.

Want to join?

Jump on the milliways mumble and test your audio before tomorrow. If you
need help connecting ask in #57n irc channel and if you still can't get
there, then email me off list.

- [tj]
