<PRE>I seem to be the first to notice that it is Tuesday (and be willing to
tell other people) this week.

Tuesday means that we have our open evening tonight: any and all are
welcome to come and visit the space, chat and/or work on
stuff. There's usually people around from 19:00.

I'll be along and probably looking at LEDs or an RFID reader and not
actually getting much done.

If you have plans: let us know what they are on -discuss. 

Robert
