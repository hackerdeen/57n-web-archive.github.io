<PRE>In a mad break from the (almost) last minute announcement that seems
to be fast becoming traditional I thought I'd try being organised and
sending this near the start of Tuesday.

It is Tuesday. That means we have the space open evening this evening.

The space will be open to any and all who would like to visit from
around 19:00 (and usually earlier).

I you haven't been along before it's best to bring a laptop and/or a
project.

If you have been along before then you should know what you're doing
now. If you want to tell the rest of us: please do over on -discuss.

I think I'll probably be working on making some more Garys - and
trying to get them to come out a bit less fat than last week's Gary.

... one of the main reasons for the fall of the Roman Empire was that,
lacking zero, they had no way to indicate successful termination of
their C programs.
