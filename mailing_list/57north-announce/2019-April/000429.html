<PRE>Hi All,

First, it's great to see the space being used on non-Tuesdays! We have a
bigger space now, but we also have a time dimension that we could be
making better use of.

Here are some dates for your diary:

----

Saturday 13th April: WeAreNameless - When Cyberpunk meets Nostalgia (in
the social room)

Event link: <A HREF="https://2600.hackers.town/wearenameless/">https://2600.hackers.town/wearenameless/</A>

Thanks to Ella Kane (@<A HREF="http://lists.57north.co/listinfo/57north-announce">ella_kane at hackers.town</A>) for organizing this event.
#WeAreNameless is a monthly community project on the Fediverse where
Hackers and their friends watch old sci-fi cyberpunk movies.

This month's movie will be The Matrix (1999) and we will begin at 19:00
UTC (20:00 Brexit Standard Time). Please arrive with plenty of time to
spare, as we will be starting at 19:00 UTC on the dot, simulwatching
with hackers around the world.

If you are not already involved in the #Fediverse, and would like to
learn more about it, then you can get an account on our very own 57North
Hacklab instance at 57n.org. Just send me an email for an invite link.

Thursday 25th April: Cryptonoise - How portable is portable? Exercising
the GDPR’s right to data portability (in the social room)

Event link: <A HREF="https://www.meetup.com/ORG-Aberdeen/events/260396674/">https://www.meetup.com/ORG-Aberdeen/events/260396674/</A>

Thanks to Janis Wong for agreeing to travel to present at this session.
As usual, we'll be starting around 19:00 BST.

The new European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) reinforces
existing data subject rights in an attempt to rebalance power between
citizens and the increasingly sizeable and international companies that
are collecting and exploiting data from them. The GDPR introduces one
new data subject right, and the focus of this talk, Article 20 the right
to data portability (RtDP). The RtDP aims to allow data subjects to
obtain and reuse their personal data for their own purposes across
different services.

As no empirical research has been done to assess the RtDP, we exercise
the right by making 230 real-world data portability requests across a
wide range of data controllers. The RtDP is interesting to study as it
operates under a framework that aims to be technologically neutral while
requiring specific technologies for implementation. Our research
assesses the ease of the RtDP process from the perspective of the data
subject and to examine the file formats returned by data controllers.

This talk will discuss the responses to 230 real-world data portability
requests, and examine the file formats returned and difficulties in
making and interpreting requests. We find variation in file formats, not
all of which meet the GDPR requirements, and confusion amongst data
controllers about the various GDPR rights. Legal and technical
recommendations and future work for various stakeholders are also be
discussed.

Feel free to contact me with any questions.

Thanks,
Iain.
