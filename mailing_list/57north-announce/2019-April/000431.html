<PRE>Hi friends, 

The Space will be open from 7pm at the space on Skene Terrace[1].

If you've not heard of us, we get up to a range of activities on Tuesday nights, including but not limited to social contact, programming, manufacturing weird things and consuming sugary treats. We usually begin at about 7, but sometimes someone will be in earlier. 
We're located downstairs from Engage Gaming. Access is through our door just beside the Assembly on Skene Terrace! If you're unsure about anything, ask in IRC[1]. 

If you're new, I'd suggest you bring a laptop, and perhaps a project you want to work on. If you're coming in, feel free to reply and tell us all what you're planning to do!

I'll be in - I'm going to continue making annoying sound boxes, and then probably some chat about campGND too. I might be in earlier as I'm working from home. 

REMINDERS: 
  - Do check the trashing page on the wiki [2]. It lists unclaimed items we intend to trash this month.
  - AGM next week!
