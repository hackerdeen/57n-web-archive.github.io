<PRE>Hi all

As those who were at the hackerspace last night will know, we had
callout visits from the Fire Service on Tuesday eve. The callouts
(automatic once the fire alarm is triggered) were false alarms caused
by a room smoke sensor that most people now agree is over sensitive.
It is unfortunately positioned directly over the nearby kitchenette
where both kettle and microwave vapours set it off. It is possible
that it can be moved but for the time being we are asking that nobody
uses our nearest kitchenette for heating/cooking items. In accordance
with this, all heating-related appliances that used to live there have
been relocated elsewhere or stacked as storage.

Washing up and cold food prep can still take place at the near sink
but please avoid using steaming hot tap water (just in case). For
boiling your water, the building rep has since agreed to us using
their kettle at the room's other kitchenette near the main room
entrance. At that other area, the smoke sensor is farther away from
the kettle so it should not be as much a problem.

I am recommending we generally become more mindful of accidentally
triggering those sensors, given we know just steam sets them off.
Creating yet another false alarm will likely cause huge problems for
all concerned.

Kind regards,
Ed
</PRE>
