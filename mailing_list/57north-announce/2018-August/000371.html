<PRE>Hi All,

Do you ever wonder what others in the hackerspace are up to, or perhaps
would like to share what you are doing with others in a blog format? The
57North Hacklab Planet is the answer for both of these thoughts!

  <A HREF="https://planet.57north.org.uk/">https://planet.57north.org.uk/</A>

The 57North Hacklab planet rounds up all the latest blog posts from the
57North hackers and presents them to you in an easy to consume format.

The planet is for any active and directly involved participant in the
57North community (of course, anyone can read the planet). Inclusion is
not restricted to people who are currently 57North members nor are
ex-members necessarily barred from inclusion.

Defining activity and direct involvement is tough and there are many
ways of participating in 57North (e.g., attending open days, mailing
list participation, IRC, etc). We are happy to consider all of these
types of involvement for the purposes of inclusion in Planet.

If you write about multiple topics on your blog it's possible to
subscribe only a tag/category as long as it has a separate RSS feed
available.

Adding your blog
================

Send an email to <A HREF="http://lists.57north.co/listinfo/57north-announce">irl at fsfe.org</A> with the subject line &quot;57North Planet
Addition&quot; with the following details:

 * Your name (this must be some printable unicode; does not need to be a
real name)
 * RSS feed URL (https preferred but not yet required)
 * A link to an image to display with your posts

You can see an example image at:

  <A HREF="https://planet.57north.org.uk/images/irl.png">https://planet.57north.org.uk/images/irl.png</A>

You can read more about these strange planet images (known as
&quot;Hackergotchi&quot;) on Wikipedia:

  <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackergotchi">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackergotchi</A>

More examples:

  <A HREF="http://planet.gnome.org/heads/">http://planet.gnome.org/heads/</A>

Please try to follow the Hackergotchi style and spirit, but it doesn't
need to be a picture of you. It could be some other object you have
laying around. Feel free to be creative.

Creating a blog
===============

You don't need to register a domain name or buy webhosting if you just
want to try out blogging!

There are many places that you can create a free blog including GitHub
pages or Netlify using a static site generator.

  <A HREF="https://pages.github.com/">https://pages.github.com/</A>
  <A HREF="https://netlify.com/">https://netlify.com/</A>

If you'd like a less technical setup, you can get started with a
Wordpress blog from motd.org from the SDF Public Access Unix System.

  <A HREF="https://sdf.org/motd/">https://sdf.org/motd/</A>

Once you've got your blog set up, follow the instructions for adding
your blog above.

Blog safely and happy blogging!

Thanks,
Iain.
