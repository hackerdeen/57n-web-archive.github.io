<PRE>Hi Folks

Quick reminder that it's Garrys Mod night tonight at the hackerspace. The
event is free for members and &#163;5 for non-members.

Those coming along will need a laptop, a free steam account and a copy of
Garrys Mod which is &#163;5.99 online from Steam. If you are buying it, please
try and have the game already downloaded beforehand. We can copy game files
over, but better to not have to.

A brief description of what the game is about:
Garry's Mod is a Sandbox Game based around the idea of building. Unlike
most other games there aren't any in-game objectives - you basically use
props and the physics engine to make stuff, ideally with others.

I have a number of objectives outlined, which we can pick and choose from
on the night:

1) Hack-up some race cars, sledges or rockets and race them on a DIY
'Dangers of the HackLab' obsticle course.

2) Build an 'the incredible machine' style setup to unlock a virtual
57north hacklab door

3) Each create a mechanical version of our 57n flashy badge.

See you there!

Cheers,
Ed (Nordin)
