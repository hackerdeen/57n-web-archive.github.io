<PRE>Hi,

There are 67 people subscribed to our announcements list, but I don't think
I've seen anywhere close to that in the space. As we're not having a Themed
Thursday tonight, we're going to have a surprise open night. This will
hopefully attract those that didn't like how organised the Tuesday open
night was and were waiting for a spontaneous open night to happen. Maybe it
will also attract those that can't, for whatever reason, make Tuesday but
can make a Thursday.

If you fit into one of those groups, or in fact any group, please come along
to the space tonight (from about 7:00) and see what we're all about. If
you're planning on coming along and you're new, introduce yourself on the
discussion mailing list[1] if you like and if you're not so new, let us know
you're coming along and what you may be working on.

Our regularly scheduled open nights will resume on Tuesday.

Iain.
