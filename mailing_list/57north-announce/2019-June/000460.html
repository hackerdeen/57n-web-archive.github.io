Again it is Tuesday, come to the space we will open our doors. Please
respond if you are coming down. Tony claims to already be there.

I will be in, if I am misbehaving I will be reverse engineering a 2 quid
router. 

I wrote a p9813 driver in a shell script yesterday so I will be boasting
about that
