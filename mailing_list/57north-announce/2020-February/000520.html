<PRE>Hello Everyone

AirAberdeen, Code the City and 57North Hacklab will be hosting an Air Quality Monitor Build workshop on the 15th of February between 10 and 2 at ONE Techhub on Schoolhill in Aberdeen. You can find more information at <A HREF="https://www.airaberdeen.org/2020/02/air-quality-monitor-build-workshop-15th-feb/">https://www.airaberdeen.org/2020/02/air-quality-monitor-build-workshop-15th-feb/</A> 

It is open to the public, and is part of a global project monitoring air quality globally. You can build a sensor and find out how they work, Also if you want to take one away to install it at your home you can buy one for £30. The sensors feed into a dataset of similar sensors around the world <A HREF="https://sensor.community/">https://sensor.community/</A> 

Get in touch if you want to reserve a sensor, or if not pass it onto anyone who you think may be interested, and feel free to come by and find out more about the project.
