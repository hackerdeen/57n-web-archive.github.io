<PRE>Hackers!

Wiiiiiiiith the winter break just around the corner, the national tradition seems
to be to have a get together and a christmas meal with some drinks.

Given this is expensive and silly, I propose we have a Pot Luck dinner
on Thursday (18th) evening. 

The rules of pot luck are pretty simple: Bring a share-size dish of something that
you love, and others do the same. You then eat bits of everything (apart
from the stuff you hate) and leave full and satisfied.

I recommend you bring your own plate and cutlery - we have neither in
the space at the moment, as well as a dish to share. 

Remember, we've got a microwave, so you can reheat things (this could be
quite amusing to watch Microwave Wars too). Food doesn't have to be
Christmas themed or seasonal. Bring pulled pork and spicy tacos or
something. Surprise us!

Shall we kick off at 7, and maybe clean/hygene-ify the space before eating
in it?

Naturally, drinks are allowed, although if anyone tries to share my gin
they'll get scared off. 

If you're coming along, post up here so that we've at least got some
pretence of coordination and we don't all just eat pudding for dinner. 

That'd be awesome, though.

Hx
