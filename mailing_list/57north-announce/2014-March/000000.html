<PRE>Sup,

The mailing lists now run on our new VPS from BitFolk. There are now two
lists.

 * <A HREF="http://lists.57north.co/listinfo/57north-announce">57north-announce at lists.57north.co</A> - Important Announcements (a few
   emails a week)
 * <A HREF="http://lists.57north.co/listinfo/57north-announce">57north-discuss at lists.57north.co</A> - General Discussion (many emails a
   day)

You have been subscribed to both lists. If you no longer want to be on
the discussion list, you can unsubscribe from it here:

<A HREF="http://lists.57north.co/listinfo/57north-discuss">http://lists.57north.co/listinfo/57north-discuss</A>

If you want to discuss items from the announcements list, this should
take place on the discussion list. You will not be able to post to the
announcements list unless you are a director of the space. If you would
like something posted on the announcement list, send it to the
discussion list with the tag [ANNOUNCEMENT] and if deemed appropriate, a
director will forward it.

If you currently have a filter in place to move the mailing list into a
folder, you may have to update this.

Both lists have been registered with Gmane and the Wiki will be updated
shortly with more details.

Iain.
