Voting has now finished. 

16 out of 18 members voted. 

We have now elected a new board of directors:
Winners are Edward Watson (nordin), Carl Anderson (noodle), Dave Hibberd
(hibby), Robert McWilliam (ormiret), and Tom Jones (adventureloop).

Members should have received a link to the results on Opavote (you
should also be able to grab the ballots and check the results if you are
so inclined). Since that will disappear in a week I've copied the
results page to <A HREF="https://57north.co/elections/2014/">https://57north.co/elections/2014/</A>
