<PRE>Hello Everyone

To all Members I will be using the space on the dates below for a workshop building Air Monitor, hopefully this is acceptable. If any of out membership is interested in building or, know someone who is get in tough or pass on this email.

----

You may all be aware we have been building Air Quality Monitors which measure fine particulates, and can be install to you own Home Wifi Network, they are based on the Luftdaten sensor and feed into their open dataset. <A HREF="https://luftdaten.info/en/">https://luftdaten.info/en/</A> you can find more information on our wiki <A HREF="https://wiki.57north.org.uk/index.php/Projects:Air_Quality_Monitor">https://wiki.57north.org.uk/index.php/Projects:Air_Quality_Monitor</A> 


We have two workshops coming to be held at our Hackerspace <A HREF="https://57north.org.uk/contact.">https://57north.org.uk/contact.</A> Attendees will need to pay for the Sensor, the cost of which is £30

* Workshop Wednesday 19th December 2018, at 6:00pm - (Provisional)

* Workshop Saturday 22nd December 2018, at 1:00pm - (Provisional)


Please include the rough location where the sensor will be installed and the workshop you are interested in attending, to help me spread the sensors and balance the workshops
