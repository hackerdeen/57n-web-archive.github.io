<PRE>Iiiiiiiiiiiiiit's Tuesday! This is probably the last open Tuesday of the year. Gosh, where have the weeks and months gone!

Last week was quiet, and there was no email - I wonder if there's a correlation! If there's no email about open Tuesday in the future, maybe you should send it - it's not a reserved privilege for a chosen few, it's just something to make our mailing list look busier than it actually is!

Consider coming to 57North tonight for cheer and social contact! We get up to a range of activities on Tuesday nights, including but not limited to social contact, programming, manufacturing weird things and consuming sugary treats. We usually begin at about 7, but sometimes someone will be in earlier. 
We're located downstairs from Engage Gaming. Access is through our door just beside the Assembly on Skene Terrace! If you're unsure about anything, ask in IRC[1]. 

If you're new, I'd suggest you bring a laptop, and perhaps a project you want to work on.

If you're coming in, feel free to reply and tell us all what you're planning to do!

I think I'll be in and making some lights blink.  

Hx
