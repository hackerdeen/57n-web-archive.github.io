<PRE>Gooooooood morning! It's still a puzzlingly mild November, which means the hacklab will be not coldish tonight! Focus, famous for Hocus Pocus and rock Yodelling in General are playing upstairs at 7 tonight, so it might be noisy between 7-9!

Consider coming to 57North tonight for cheer and social contact! We get up to a range of activities on Tuesday nights, including but not limited to social contact, programming, manufacturing weird things and consuming sugary treats. We usually begin at about 7, but sometimes someone will be in earlier. 
We're located downstairs from Engage Gaming. Access is through our door just beside the Assembly on Skene Terrace! If you're unsure about anything, ask in IRC[1]. 

If you're new, I'd suggest you bring a laptop, and perhaps a project you want to work on.

If you're coming in, feel free to reply and tell us all what you're planning to do!

I shall be in a little bit later than normal with an accomplice, and then working on stuff. Probably continuing organisation for the ScotCon winter bash, staring at a trello board and flapping around aimlessly a little.
