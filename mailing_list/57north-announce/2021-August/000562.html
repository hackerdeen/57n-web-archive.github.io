<PRE>Hi All!

It's been ages since we had a social event, so let's hang out and celebrate Free Software projects!

A lot of Free Software projects have had major releases this year. 
To name a few that members of the hacklab are excited by or involved in: 

  * Debian[1] released version 11 just last week and I'm excited
  * FreeBSD[2] released version 13 in April, and tj is excited.
  * OpenBSD[3] had their 50th major release, 6.9, in May and irl is excited.
  * Joomla[4] has released version 4 this week and Andyg is excited! 
  * Fedora[5] release 34 in April and I'm sure someone is excited?

If you are contributing to these projects, ! If I've missed the one that you're excited by, I'm sorry, just reply and tell us! 

Let's gather at the space on Sunday, 22nd August at 3pm and talk about our favorite free software projects and why they're cool. Presentations (in ODP) in 3 part harmony are not mandatory! 
I will probably try and BBQ some food at 5/6pm as a stand in for &quot;dinner&quot; - you are welcome to do the same! This depends on the weather, which is currently listed as &quot;overcast&quot;. 

I'll be bringing some beer, but there is also a great new coffee machine (espresso and drip) that was gifted by Marcel and tea-making facilities available as normal. Be sure to bring some ground beans!
Should people want, I can restock the shop with club mate and other soft drinks also!

If you plan to come in and play, shoot a message to the mailing list. 
I think we're all happy for you to bring friends/others to the space, and but remember that as this event is open to the public, the wearing of a face covering while &quot;not seated, eating or drinking&quot; is a legal requirement.

The worst case scenario is that I'm on my own at 57N BBQing food and drinking beer for an afternoon/evening while working on space infrastructure projects, it's not such a bad life.
