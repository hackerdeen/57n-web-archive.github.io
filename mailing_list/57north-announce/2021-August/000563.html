<PRE>Hi everyone,

During the last year and a bit, many of us have been enjoying each others'
company on Mumble, and then WorkAdventure/Jitsi, on Tuesday and Friday
nights. I'd like to thank everyone who helped organise these, they are a
great way to keep in touch and they were a source of comfort during some
pretty bleak lockdowns.

As normality starts to slowly return these sessions have understandably
been less well attended. Rather than let them die off I suggest that we
have a session, once a month, to make it easier for more of us to get
together at the same time.

The 1st Consular Convention for Control &amp; Prohibition of Pandemics (1CCCPP)
will be on the third Friday of each month, at 8pm Aberdeen time, beginning
tonight on WorkAdventure [1]. I will send announcement emails for these
further in advance in future. The next one after tonight will be the 17th
of September, pop it in your calendar now if you fancy attending.

The format would be exactly as it is now: turn up, have a few lemonades,
and shoot the breeze. My hope is that it will be a regular catch-up for
57North and Scottish Consulate diaspora around the world.

Any comments and suggestions are welcome. Hope to see you on WorkAdventure
this evening.

Cheers,

Nick
