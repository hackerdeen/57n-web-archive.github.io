Subject: [57north-announce] [REMOTE] Tuesday Mumble
Message-ID: <CAPY_hgfLLdXHWdd+7Z==OHakt_p0_mim2xAWnmnocH4vc=4pzg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Hackers,

Tuesday has arrived, as it always must.

Before Wednesday butts it's way in and starts stealing your good
coffee, why not drop by your local hacker community and listen to the
sharing of news, project progress and other fine word sounds.

We will be on mumble from about 2000. Catch you there.

Cheers,
Nordin
