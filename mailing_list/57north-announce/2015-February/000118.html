<PRE>Hello Hackers,

Once again it is Tuesday, 57North Hacklab's weekly open night. Where anyone is
welcome to come to the space and see what we get up to. Normally there is some
working on projects, drinking of tea and wondering where the compose key is.

If you are heading in tonight, you should reply to this message on -discuss and
let everyone know. If you have been working on something cool and need some
extra hands, ask here too.

-----

If you would like something announced on a Tuesday please contact Tom
&lt;<A HREF="http://lists.57north.co/listinfo/57north-announce">jones at sdf.org</A>&gt;

We have a newsletter and without your contributions it is just Tom speaking to
himself. If you have been working on a project, have been on an adventure or
just have an idea, submit stories to the editor. &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.57north.co/listinfo/57north-announce">editor at 57north.co</A>&gt;
