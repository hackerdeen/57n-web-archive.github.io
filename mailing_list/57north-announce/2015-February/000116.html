<PRE>Hello Hackers,

Just a reminder that Jim Killock from the Open Rights Group will be talking at
the University of Aberdeen tonight. Full details are on the meetup page, please
note; you do not have to sign up to attend the event.


 &quot; A minor, barely noticed consultation is not the way to make a major change to
 Scottish citizens&#8217; privacy and their relationship with the state. Creating a
 national ID register was rejected by the SNP at the UK, and the bare minimum
 should be for the Scottish Executive to introduce primary legislation whereby
 the public and MSPs can debate the nature of these changes and whether they
 are acceptable. &quot;


Please distribute the details of this event widely.
