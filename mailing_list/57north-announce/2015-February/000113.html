<PRE>Fit like m'Louns &amp; m'Quines?

It's Monday, a day viewed by some to be full of tension and disquiet.
Let's not be those people, and intrepidly quest forth into another
exciting week full of opportunity and new experiences.

To help you on your way, it's ABZ.Electron in the space tonight! Come
along, and have some quiet time to work on your projects, or start one
if you've not got any on the go! If you're put off by the chaos of a
Tuesday night, this will be a more productive evening for you.

I've got lots of stuff I'll be working on: I've just got my amprnet
allocation, so I'll be thinking again about starting LIDNET and packet
radio in general. I'll be working on my RasPi2 - trying to get audio
running on pureish debian and then retrace my steps and try to
debootstrap something and make that a rootfs file and stuff. Handwaving
ahoy! I'll also be about as a reference for electronics if you want any
assistance with circuits, transfer functions, laplace transforms and
other things I should probably know about!

If you're coming in, ping an email t'list to say what you're doing.

Much love

Hibby x
