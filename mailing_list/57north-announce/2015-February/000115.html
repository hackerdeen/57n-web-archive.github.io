<PRE>Hello Hackers,

On Monday the 16th of February 2015 Jim Killock, Director of the Open Rights
Group will be speaking at the University of Aberdeen. Jim will be speaking
about ID Card systems that are being introduced in Scotland and mass
surveillance issues in the upcoming Westminster election.

Come along to discuss how we can stop the Scottish Government's plans to create
a national identity database. 

&quot;A minor, barely noticed consultation is not the way to make a major change to
Scottish citizens&#8217; privacy and their relationship with the state. Creating a
national ID register was rejected by the SNP at the UK, and the bare minimum
should be for the Scottish Executive to introduce primary legislation whereby
the public and MSPs can debate the nature of these changes and whether they are
acceptable.&quot;

Join us at 1800 with the session starting from 1830.

There is more information here:

Please distribute the details of this event far and wide.
