<PRE>** Update 9 Sept, 16:30 **

So far, the following awesome people have donated for the space's own
delta-bot 3D printer:

Nordin
[tj]
Hibby
Ormiret
Irl

Cheers people. Print yourself a fancy prize. Did I mention that those
donating optionally get their very own nick sprawled across it? I am
sure I did.

Running total of donations: &#163;170
Target: &#163;192.99 (the price went up a few pounds this afternoon - dam)
= &#163;22.99 to go.

Don't worry if you think others will have pledged enough by the time
you see this - I propose that any extra monies we get, we hold for
import taxes that will likely be due me on import. If not, a heated
bed add-on might be nice.

Cheers,
Nordin (Ed)

Hi all

I have started working on the space 3D printer again (the new and
improved 'bloody noisy' edition). Cooling the extruder has stopped it
from ceasing but it looks like the variable bed level and destructive
layering of filament is still a barrier to casual use. I really need
to spend some time on it, probably at home. Adding a bed-levelling
mechanism will solve the first issue, and hopefully tight calibration
will deal with the second. That aside, given that it's a hybrid
design, ongoing reliability might be an ongoing issue until we can
refine the design once it's back in the space.

I for one have a number of projects that could really use a 3D printer
nowish. I also want people to be able to use it with relative ease.
To give the space a working 3D printer sooner, I propose we collect
donations for a Rostock Kossel Mini self-levelling deltabot 3D
printer. [1]. This one is currently on sale pretty cheap for &#163;189.90
all in from HK. It looks well documented, space efficient and we have
kit experience within reach of the space. We have my networked
RaspiCam set up as a 3d printer server that is also directly
compatible, plus a selection of high-grade filiment.

The nice-looking parts that Arthur kindly printed for us for the
current printer were (as I understand) printed on device very much
like this, which has a smaller build volume (170 x 170 x 240mm) but is
easier to use with pretty consistent results

If you are interested in contributing towards it, please email to
discuss.  I'll be happy to build it, but o/c anyone can join the
party. Delivery is estimated between Tue. 22 Sep. and Mon. 12 Oct.
There also import tax that can apply.

If I get pledges up to &#163;140 by today I'll purchase on the credit card
and probably pay the difference myself.

Cheers,
Ed
