<PRE>Hi,

It's Tuesday again. This does seem to happen every week.

This week is a cryptonoise week. The current law in the UK offers little
protection from mass surveillance and provides little or no oversight. Tor,
an anonymity tool, offers a safe environment for browsing the web without
the threat of leaking your identity everywhere you go. People like you and
your family use Tor to protect themselves, their children, and their dignity
while using the Internet. Businesses use Tor to research competition, keep
business strategies confidential, and facilitate internal accountability.
Activists use Tor to anonymously report abuses from danger zones.
Whistleblowers use Tor to safely report on corruption. Journalists and the
media use Tor to protect their research and sources online. If you'd like to
come and learn about Tor in an environment that also serves drinks, come
along to Cryptonoise today from 5pm to 7pm in the Illicit Still.

The space also has its weekly open day today. Come along to the space from
7pm and see what we're all about if you haven't done so yet. If you're
coming along, send a message to 57north-discuss with what you plan to be
looking at while at the space to let people know.

Hope to see you later today at cryptonoise, the hacklab, or both.

Iain.
