<PRE>Once again it is Tuesday, 57North's weekly open night. Anyone is welcome to
come to the space and see what we get up to and to share a drink.

Any members coming in with a plan should reply to this on -discuss

We need to replenish our beer supply and the 24 hour shop is not the best
place.  There is &#163;20 in &#163;1 coins to get some beer, traditionally it is
Carlsberg, but I think that is because Carl does a lot of the beer buying.


CryptoNoise is also tonight, from 1700-1900 we will be in the Illicit Still
using TOR. If you want to know more check out cryptonoise.org
