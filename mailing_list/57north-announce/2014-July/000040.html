       We  went  camping.  It  was rather enjoyable and we did even
       manage to get some hacking done. My biggest worry  was  that
       we  weren't  going to be able to get the wifi working and at
       first it looked like that was going to be the case but  once
       we shortened the cable a bit between the house and the first
       wireless access point, the  PoE  managed  to  negotiate  and
       hibby  was  already on Facebook before adventureloop thought
       he had started to set it up.

       irl and hibby played around with packet  radio  a  bit,  but

       unfortunately  were  not able to hit the International Space
       Station. This was primarily due to  soundmodem  being  awful
       and we're now using direwolf instead.

       nordin built a projector screen that worked brilliantly, but
       unfortunately the projector seemed to draw  too  much  power
       from  the  generator  and  it couldn't keep up so we weren't
       able to watch a movie.

       A large amount of bacon was eaten all round  and  next  year
       I'm  sure  we'll  be  even  better prepared for some outdoor
       hacking (hopefully with better weather).

       Those that have been  in  the  space  recently  or  came  to
       campGND will have noticed that radios have started to appear
       in the space. I primarily blame hibby for this, as they  are
       hibby's radios.

       Radios  can be used to talk to other people with radios, but
       the definition of the  word  talk  here  can  mean  multiple
       things. We're quite interested in packet radio, sending data
       over the airwaves.

       We've already experimented with recieving ADS-B traffic from
       planes  to  track  them across the skies and we've sent APRS
       packets around the world through the local IGate.

       Some projects we'd like to work  on  include  setting  up  a
       permanent ADS-B tracker, a bi-directional IGate (the current
       one is recieve only) and a radio BBS.

       Speak to irl or hibby about these projects if you'd like  to
       get involved. You will need to be licensed to use the radios
       we have in the space and the local radio club will  be  able
       to  provide  you  with  training  and organise your exam for
       this.
