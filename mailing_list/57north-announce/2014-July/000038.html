<PRE>All,

I appear to have had us set up yet another mailing list - the name
suggests it's for music. Let's talk about music.

My initial idea for the mailing list wass that we have threads for music
types - a megathread of per genre, effectively, to keep things neatly
organised with new music suggestions that you can walk through. I'm
starting that off today with an &quot;Electro pose&quot; genre because some of us
are digging that vibe currently. It's probably going to be badly
organised, but it'll be an archive of music to get lost in.

I've got a secondary idea of getting some 'tunehacking' on the go in the
space. A monthly or biweekly night dedicated to people wanting to make
music happen in its various forms - building equipment / instruments,
circuit bending, making chiptunes, bringing a guitar along and
serenading us, that kind of thing. It'd also be cool to get technicians
for sound and stuff involved too - build your own DMX controller, that
kind of thing.

If/when we get that running, I reckon our next move is to get in
touch with 57North, our local music hub and advertise/announce through
them - best case scenario, we get some new members interested in
collaborating with us and/or understanding, designing and  building 
their own kit. Worst case scenario, people get a wee bit confused with
<A HREF="http://lists.57north.co/listinfo/57north-announce">57North at 57n.</A> 

So that's 57north-music. Questions? Comments? Suggestions? Abuse?

Hx
