<PRE>Hello Everyone,

Today is Tuesday and that means it is our Openday. So come by and bring
you projects your friends, and if none of those are available bring a
laptop.

We aim to be social but some of us will be working on projects, wo may
seem introvert but we do want your company.

Today being the first Tuesday of the month, is also the evening for
climate cafe[1] and Scotland Data Science &amp; Technology MeetUp[2] I'll
probably be heading to the former before, so I will be late tonight,

Hope to see you then, if not hope to see you next week.

Midder
