<PRE>Goooooooood day!

You should make your way in to 57N tonight to talk about tech and play with toys!

If you've not heard of us, we get up to a range of activities on Tuesday nights, including but not limited to social contact, programming, manufacturing weird things and consuming sugary treats. We usually begin at about 7, but sometimes someone will be in earlier. 
We're located downstairs from Engage Gaming. Access is through our door just beside the Assembly on Skene Terrace! If you're unsure about anything, ask in IRC[1]. 

If you're new, I'd suggest you bring a laptop, and perhaps a project you want to work on.

If you're coming in, feel free to reply and tell us all what you're planning to do!

There's lots happening tonight! Come on down and get involved :) I'm expecting the science centre crew to come and say hi to talk about building something cool for their Easter holidays display!

Ongoing, we're still probably setting up a laser cutter, i'm still probably setting up a barcode-scanenr powered honesty bar, there will be the final preparations for the Air Quality monitoring Code the City this weekend that we're doing in partnership with the open data institute team [2]. There's a few other personal projects happening too - I saw some wood being cut in the dirty workshop not too long ago!

Cheers,

Hx
