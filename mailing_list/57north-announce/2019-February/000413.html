<PRE>Hello Everyone

I would like to point out that next weekend is the Code the City Airdata
Hackathon there are only a handfull of tickets left to if you are
interested get along to eventbrite to pick one up[1]. There is more info
about the event on the CTC website[2]

If they run out and you want to attend give me a shout and I'll see what
I can do. Please forward this to anyone you know who may be interested.

I'll be in the space tomorrow (Sunday) preparing the kits if anyone is
at a loose end.

Midder.
