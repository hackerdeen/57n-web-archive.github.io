<PRE>Good golly, its another hackerspace Open Tuesday. The space will be
open to any and all who would like to visit from around 19:00 (usually
earlier). If you haven't been along before, it's best to bring a
laptop and/or a project.

During their long working day, scientists love destroying bad theories
and reach for better ones, however they have a hard time making
products without help. Between an efficient breakfast and dinner,
engineers are wonderful producers but are often having too much fun
improving their profession's tools, sometimes overindulging in
technical correctness over human acceptance. Between glowing sunrise
and sunset, artists warm the room using their creative minds to
combine patterns from dull areas of life to build exciting new ones,
but can flutter widely as they veer between self-defined targets....
but then...
.. then there are also people who destroy, reach, up-tool, overdulge,
create and flutter *all at once* in one coffee/beer soaked evening.
Pop over this evening to be one of those excellent few :)

See you there!
Nordin
</PRE>
