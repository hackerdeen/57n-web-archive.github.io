The Hackerspace goes camping

Hi friends! I thought I'd send you all a reminder, as campGND is drawing closer.

Don't know what campGND is? campGND is a weekend long camping festival for 
hackers and makers running June 2nd, 3rd and 4th 2017 

campGND will be held in a scenic location near Huntly in the North East of 
Scotland. We will have power, wifi and maybe even mesh networks. 

campGND is put on by members of 57North hackerspace for most any neighbourly folk
that want to join us. We need your help to build out infrastructure to keep the
hacking going from a field - the more the merrier.

If you've got any questions about what you'll need to bring, want to ask if 
anyone has any car space you can steal or want to know the nearest bus stop,
just reply to this email and we can have a chat. 

We have some basic details on our wiki, it'll be expanded as we get closer
thanks to last minute organisation!
<A HREF="https://scottishconsulate.org/campgnd2017/overview">https://scottishconsulate.org/campgnd2017/overview</A>

Add your name, project, origin and mode of transport to the wiki so we know
who's coming and the interesting stuff you'll be doing! It also helps us to
coordinate transport and reduce our environmental impact!

Sling us a tweet @campgnd if you've got any questions, comments or feedback.

Much love,

Hibby &amp; [tj]
