<PRE>Morning friends!
Oh my goodness,  it's the end of April! How did that happen?

Why is it snowing? What direction is up? Is the earth flat?

Find out the answers to these questions and more at 57North tonight!

Today is open Tuesday at 57N and all are invited to come along after
7pm!

For those of you not in the know, Tuesday evenings are open to anyone
who wishes to come to 57North, Aberdeen's hackerspace[1]! We get up to a
range of activities on Tuesday nights, including but not limited to
social contact, programming, manufacturing weird things and consuming
sugary treats. 
We usually begin at about 7, but sometimes someone will be in earlier. 
If you're unsure, ask in IRC[2]!

If you're new, I'd suggest you bring a laptop, and perhaps a project you
want to work on.

If you're coming in, feel free to reply and tell us all what you're
planning to do!

I will be fiddling with vagrant, gns3, VMs in general and muttering
about that time I bought Avon products from yer da.
