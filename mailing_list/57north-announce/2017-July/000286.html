<PRE>Hello all

It is Tuesday, which means we have our Openday The space is open from 7pm location <A HREF="https://57north.org.uk/contact,">https://57north.org.uk/contact,</A> come one come all and experience the phun that is hacker culture.

So give us a replay and inform us:


# If you will or won't be down

I'll be there. I'll probably be at the space early afternoon.


# what will you be working on

Probably gyroscopes and accelerometers.


# what goodness do you have to share this week.

I have had more time to read books I want to read, and been reading them, this makes my brain happy.



Pile in Peons.

Doc.
