<PRE>Another week has gone by,
I need an excuse to debug the new lists because the web archive isn't working for some reason

here's a reminder, and a poem that isn't
a haiku.

Howdy!

We've been talking about this for ages and I think we're just about at
the point in time where we can actually start moving towards using the
new mailing lists over the old ones!

Our new lists are all the same addresses @lists.57north.org.uk, using
that &quot;new&quot; domain of ours.

I'm not going to autosubscribe you as that would be an abuse of your
data, but should you wish to keep a relationship with us you can find
the 3 lists at <A HREF="https://lists.57north.org.uk/mailman3/postorius/lists/">https://lists.57north.org.uk/mailman3/postorius/lists/</A>

We've got -announce, -discuss and -ctte. All are welcome to join each of
the lists and contribute your thoughts.

We'll be decommissioning this list at some point soon, in a week or
two. I'll send a reminder before it happens.

If you have any issues, reply here or shout on irc!
