<PRE>Hello Everyone.

Tuesday again, so we will have our weekly open night, We have moved to  a new location at Kettock Lodge. The address for the new space is:

Suite H
Kettock Lodge
Innovation Park
Campus Two
Bridge of Don
Aberdeen AB22 8GU

There's plenty parking! 

But if you don't have transport get in touch her or IRC and someone may be able to help you out[1].

If you've not heard of us, we get up to a range of activities on Tuesday nights, including but not limited to social contact, programming, manufacturing weird things and consuming sugary treats. We usually begin at about 7, but sometimes someone will be in earlier. 

If you're new, I'd suggest you bring a laptop, and perhaps a project you want to work on.

If you're coming in, feel free to reply and tell us all what you're planning to do!

I'll be at the old space for about 6 to pick up stuff, then head out to the new space for 7, I have space for 2 people if anyone needs a lift, and I'll be heading back to the city centre when we finish.



Midder
