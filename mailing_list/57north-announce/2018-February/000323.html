<PRE>Gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooood Morning hackers!

It's once gain a chilly, snowy Tuesaday out here in the 'shire!
What a perfect day to stay indoors and play with computers. Unless you're into Alestorm and/or pirates, in which case Piratefest at the Garage is the place you should be tonight. 

For those of you not in the know, Tuesday evenings are open to anyone
who wishes to come to 57North, Aberdeen's Hackerspace[1]! We get up to a
range of activities on Tuesday nights, including but not limited to
social contact, programming, manufacturing weird things and consuming
sugary treats. 
We usually begin at about 7, but sometimes someone will be in earlier. 
If you're unsure, ask in IRC[2]!

If you're new, I'd suggest you bring a laptop, and perhaps a project you
want to work on.

If you're coming in, feel free to reply and tell us all what you're
planning to do!

I shall be in for about 630/7ish, via McDonald's as they have the GRAND BIG MAC[3] and I'd like to contribute more to my heart condition. Alternatively, tofu &amp; noods from Dr Noodles. 

Tonight I shall mostly be working on Debian Packages. I have the big laptop and silly stand in so I can run `make -j 8` and make fan whirr noises.  I shall also enjoy the Burger King Song [4] once or twice.
