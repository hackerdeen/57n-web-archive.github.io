<PRE>Happy Tuesday everyone!

Welcome June! The year's half way point arrives soon, and 
the weather is glorious!

I hope all y'all that came to play at the weekend had a great  time
and have recovered!

Today is open Tuesday at 57N and all are invited to come along after
7pm!

For those of you not in the know, Tuesday evenings are open to anyone
who wishes to come to 57North, Aberdeen's Hackerspace[1]! We get up to a
range of activities on Tuesday nights, including but not limited to
social contact, programming, manufacturing weird things and consuming
sugary treats. 
We usually begin at about 7, but sometimes someone will be in earlier. 
If you're unsure, ask in IRC[2]!

If you're new, I'd suggest you bring a laptop, and perhaps a project you
want to work on.

If you're coming in, feel free to reply and tell us all what you're
planning to do!

I'm probably not coming in, I feel the need to hide under my duvet and
consider the fact I'm spinning too many plates in my life at the moment.
