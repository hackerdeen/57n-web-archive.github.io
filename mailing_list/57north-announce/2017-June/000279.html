<PRE>Good Tuesday everyone!

We are staring down the end of June somehow, and the good weather
has come and gone for the rest of the country. 

Maybe you should come and play this fine Tuesday evening, because:

Today is open Tuesday at 57N and all are invited to come along after
7pm!

For those of you not in the know, Tuesday evenings are open to anyone
who wishes to come to 57North, Aberdeen's hackerspace[1]! We get up to a
range of activities on Tuesday nights, including but not limited to
social contact, programming, manufacturing weird things and consuming
sugary treats.

We usually begin at about 7, but sometimes someone will be in earlier. 
If you're unsure, ask in IRC[2]!

If you're new, I'd suggest you bring a laptop, and perhaps a project you
want to work on.

If you're coming in, feel free to reply and tell us all what you're
planning to do!

All signs point towards me being in, I shall be doing something, but I'm
not yet sure what.
