<PRE>The inevitability of time marching on has brought us round to Tuesday
once again. So, 57N will be open this evening to any of the masses
that feel like coming along to visit. Should be open by 19:00.

If you've not been before: it's best to bring a laptop or a project to
work on.

If anyone has plans for what they'll be doing: let us know over on
-discuss.

I should be along - will probably be doing something with controlling
LEDs, might have a go at actually getting my ESP32 up and running. Or
more likely I'll look at code occasionally and not actually make any
progress...

Robert
