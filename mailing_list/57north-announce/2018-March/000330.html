<PRE>It's a lovely morning out here in Westhill , and spring has begin with blue skies and not too much wind!

For those of you not in the know, Tuesday evenings are open to anyone
who wishes to come to 57North, Aberdeen's Hackerspace[1]! We get up to a
range of activities on Tuesday nights, including but not limited to
social contact, programming, manufacturing weird things and consuming
sugary treats. 
We usually begin at about 7, but sometimes someone will be in earlier. 
If you're unsure, ask in IRC[2]!

If you're new, I'd suggest you bring a laptop, and perhaps a project you
want to work on.

If you're coming in, feel free to reply and tell us all what you're
planning to do!

I shall be in for about 7ish. I'll be fannying about with the network slightly (I got IPv6 working on both wired &amp; wireless at the weekend) and feeling sad about our WAN speed.
