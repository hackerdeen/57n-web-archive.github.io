<PRE>After the terror, chaos and wild weather caused by my being busy and not having time to send the email last week, all has returned to a steady state of calm and productivity.

For those of you not in the know, Tuesday evenings are open to anyone
who wishes to come to 57North, Aberdeen's Hackerspace[1]! We get up to a
range of activities on Tuesday nights, including but not limited to
social contact, programming, manufacturing weird things and consuming
sugary treats. 
We usually begin at about 7, but sometimes someone will be in earlier. 
If you're unsure, ask in IRC[2]!

If you're new, I'd suggest you bring a laptop, and perhaps a project you
want to work on.

If you're coming in, feel free to reply and tell us all what you're
planning to do!

I shall be in for about 7ish. I'll be showing off my first test builds of Debian Hamradio Blend Live image, working on the next one, talking about having one of my GPG keys on a yubikey, sending a few emails and dossing around happily. 

Hx
