<PRE>Hello Hackers,

Once again it is Tuesday, 57North Hacklab's weekly open night. Anyone is
welcome to come a long and see what we get up to in the space. Normally there
is some hacking on projects, working on projects and wondering which cool kids
are going to have articles in the newsletter.

If you are planning to head in tonight fire off an email to -discuss and let
everyone else know. This is your chance to let everyone know about the cool
project you have been working on, ask for help or mumble about an idea you
have.

-----
57North have a quarterly newsletter which cannot happen without articles from
our members. If you have an awesome project complete or in the works, have been
on an adventure or have something else to share please submit an article to the
Editor &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.57north.co/listinfo/57north-announce">editor at 57north.co</A>&gt;.

Articles should be 200-300 words and must not have been published elsewhere
before the newsletter is released. Yes your blog counts as publication.
