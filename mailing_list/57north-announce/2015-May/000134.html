<PRE>Hello Hackers,

Again it is Tuesday, 57North's weekly open night. Anyone is welcome to come a
long and see what we get up to, normally there is some hacking on projects,
drinking of tea and wondering what day it is(it might be Tuesday).

If you are planning to head in fire off an email to -discuss and let everyone
else know. This is your weekly chance to let everyone know the cool things you
have been up to.

-----

57North has a quarterly newsletter, without your submissions it will be an
empty dream. If you have been working on a project, have been somewhere awesome
or just have an idea you want to share please submit an article to the editor
&lt;<A HREF="http://lists.57north.co/listinfo/57north-announce">editor at 57north.co</A>&gt;
