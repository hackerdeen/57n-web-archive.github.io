<PRE>It is Tuesday. On this special day we celebrate general hackering and
friendship by childishly assembling together like some sort of duplo
build (or megabloks).

The space will be open to any and all who would like to visit from
around 19:00 (usually earlier).

I you haven't been along before, it's best to bring a laptop and/or a
project. Just bringing yourself is good too tho  :)

I will be there doing programming the space's new digital yuletide
fireplace. What will you doing tho.. ??

Cheers,
Nordin
