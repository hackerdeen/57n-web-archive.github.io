<PRE>It is Tuesday once more. A day of hacking and rude exchanges about
which programming language sucks the least.

My favourite language today is lisp - the language built exclusively
to run video rental store databases skynet-style. PHP7 also looks good
so far from my position of general ignorance (ducks to avoid flying
bricks). Python runs our 'the matrix' so we don't count that.

The space will be open to any and all who would like to visit from
around 19:00. If you haven't been along before, it's best to bring a
laptop and/or a project. Just bringing yourself is good too tho  :)

I will not be there as I need my fibre internets for important tasking
at home. I'll be IRC'ing tho - come join us!

Cheers,
Nordin
