<PRE>Morning all! 

Just a quick reminder from me: this upcoming weekend (20th, 21st and
22nd of October) is the first 57North Game Jam!

What's a game jam?

It's a get together of people to make games! You turn up and create
something that you'd enjoy playing. Learn more here [1].

What kind of games?

Any! Board/Video/Card/Crypto/Blockchain/whatever! Just because some of
us will be programming doesn't mean you need to do the same. They can be
silly, serious, important, easy or difficult.

Who can take part?

Anyone, but we ask that non members of 57N make a donation to the
hackerspace. You are welcome to bring friends and team up, or create
something on your own. Throw your name on the wiki[2] and/or reply here.

What does my game have to be about?

At the moment, we don't have a set topic to base games on - feel free to
suggest one, or to suggest that we shouldn't have a topic at all!


Feel free to come for a day, a few hours, or come for the whole weekend!
It'll be a relaxed, social event!


Remember to come prepared - because our internet connection is slow, if
you turn up and want to download Unity to make shiny 3d games with,
you're gonna have a bad day!
