<PRE>I wish thee a good morning upon this damp Hallowe'en!
Traditionally all are welcome  at the 57N open Tuesday, but today we
wish to extend a special welcome to our supernatural, extraordinary and
unusual friends from the spirit, and all other, realms. 

If you are not supernatural or from a separate realm, you are encouraged
today to dress up as a fantastic beast:
You could come as David S Pumpkins, the scariest of them all[1], or
perhaps a spooky, scary skeleton[2].
Maybe you'll just be generall spoopy[3] or dressed up unconvincingly as
an animal[4], for example, Gary the Unicorn.
Tbh, I'm just after an excuse to dress up. 

Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaanywayyyyyyyyyyyyyyy:

It is also Open Tuesday at 57North! All are welcome to come along this
evening after about 7pm.

For those of you not in the know, Tuesday evenings are open to anyone
who wishes to come to 57North, Aberdeen's Hackerspace[5]! We get up to a
range of activities on Tuesday nights, including but not limited to
social contact, programming, manufacturing weird things and consuming
sugary treats. 
We usually begin at about 7, but sometimes someone will be in earlier. 
If you're unsure, ask in IRC[6]!

If you're new, I'd suggest you bring a laptop, and perhaps a project you
want to work on.

If you're coming in, feel free to reply and tell us all what you're
planning to do!

I shall be in for about 6ish faffing around with raspberry pis and
infobeamer.

I'm looking to borrow a couple (2 or 3) Raspberry Pis (2 or 3) over the
coming weeks - they shall be returned on the  14th November.  I also
require HDMI cables and for them! Is anyone able to volunteer some for
me to take on my upcoming adventures?
