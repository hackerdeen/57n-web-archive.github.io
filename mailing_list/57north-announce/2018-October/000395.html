<PRE>Howdy! It's as bit of a mingin day outside, which makes  coming to 57North a great idea! I'd love to see some hallowe'en themed dressing up, but alas I don't have a fun costume in the office with me, so I'm going to turn up as &quot;mildly disgruntled, comfort eating engineer with too many personal projects needing urgently finished&quot;.

Anyway, on with the show!

Consider coming to 57North tonight for cheer and social contact! We get up to a range of activities on Tuesday nights, including but not limited to social contact, programming, manufacturing weird things and consuming sugary treats. We usually begin at about 7, but sometimes someone will be in earlier. 
We're still settling in to our new location, downstairs from Engage Gaming. Access is through our door just beside the Assembly on Skene Terrace! If you're unsure about anything, ask in IRC[1]. 

If you're new, I'd suggest you bring a laptop, and perhaps a project you want to work on.

If you're coming in, feel free to reply and tell us all what you're planning to do!

I shall be in and working on code. Bit of info-beamer, bit of wifi, bit of mate, bit of beer. Usual me.
