<PRE>Happy Ada Lovelace Day, friends!

Today is an international celebration of the achievements of women in STEM subjects. Take a minute to learn about the impact of women in your own field - I'm sure you'll be surprised by something or someone! 

If you're not aware of Ada Lovelace herself, learn more about her significant contributions to early computer science and Babbage's magical machine here [1].  

Once you've read that, consider coming to 57North! [2] get up to a range of activities on Tuesday nights, including but not limited to social contact, programming, manufacturing weird things and consuming sugary treats. We usually begin at about 7, but sometimes someone will be in earlier. 
We're still settling in to our new location, downstairs from Engage Gaming. Access is through our door just beside the Forum on Skene Terrace! If you're unsure about anything, ask in IRC[3]. 

If you're new, I'd suggest you bring a laptop, and perhaps a project you want to work on.

If you're coming in, feel free to reply and tell us all what you're planning to do!

I shall be in and doing stuff as yet undefined. Standing in the workshop and thinking round some problems most likely. Faffing a little before the weekend's entertainment too.
