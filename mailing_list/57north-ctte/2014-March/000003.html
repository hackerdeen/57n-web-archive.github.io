<PRE>Disagree strongly with that Iain, both regarding classifying loaned
kit a &quot;ours&quot; or discouraging loans in general.

We have a choice whether to accept a loan &amp; I believe in this case it
would've been better to say &quot;thanks but no thanks&quot;, without changing
space policy on loans full stop &amp; upsetting someone who's trying to
help &amp; has been veritably loaning other kit.

For example if discussed bringing a dremel &amp; pillar drill to the space
on long term loan.

There is *no* way I'd do that if it'd be considered space property.

I know what you're trying to avoid &amp; happy to discuss (in fact i think
we all *need* to discuss...) but I think this is like using a
thermonuclear warhead to crack a nut ;)

Regards
Tony

</I>&gt;<i> That was probably me. My point was that we didn't want Calum to just
</I>&gt;<i> come in one day and take the 42U rack away leaving us with a mess of
</I>&gt;<i> previously racked equipment all over the space.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> In all seriousness, longer term it's not going to hurt us to pop a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> clarification on the wiki regarding items left outside of boxes, but I'm
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> hoping this is just a case of cross wires somewhere.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is a special case, because it's infrastructure of the space, not
</I>&gt;<i> just a project. The whole space becomes disadvantaged if Calum comes in
</I>&gt;<i> and removes it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We should get some documentation up on the wiki about these things
</I>&gt;<i> though. I would have it say something along the lines of the following:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (a) If equipment is installed outside of the space to form
</I>&gt;<i> infrastructure for the space, it will be considered property of 57North
</I>&gt;<i> Hacklab and be available for use by all members as long as that use does
</I>&gt;<i> not impair the use of other members.
</I>&gt;<i> (b) If a project is in progress that requires equipment larger than can
</I>&gt;<i> reasonably be placed into your storage box, for either volume or mass
</I>&gt;<i> reasons, it may be stored under a standing desk as long as it is not
</I>&gt;<i> inconveniencing other members. This storage should be considered
</I>&gt;<i> short-term unless the project is really cool.
</I>&gt;<i> (c) If you are unclear, email <A HREF="http://lists.57north.co/listinfo/57north-ctte">57north-ctte at lists.57north.co</A> for
</I>&gt;<i> clarification.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Did anyone seriously say to him that any item left in the space is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> considered hackspace property?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I didn't say that, I just said that if he is going to have the 42U rack
</I>&gt;<i> in replacing the 24U rack then it should at least be in the space on the
</I>&gt;<i> same or better terms as the 24U rack in that it will remain in the space
</I>&gt;<i> for as long there is a space unless superseded. Saying that, I don't
</I>&gt;<i> want the 24U rack back and I consider it to be property of 57North
</I>&gt;<i> Hacklab now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Because if so, I'd like it on record that I consider that to be a really
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> silly idea, as it will discourage anyone from ever loaning us stuff.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Maybe it's best if people don't loan us stuff, especially infrastructure
</I>&gt;<i> stuff. Just sayin'.
