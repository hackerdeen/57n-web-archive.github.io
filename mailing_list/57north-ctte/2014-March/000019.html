<PRE>Cheers Tom, appreciate the update.

Will grab logins for managing our company, likely around lunch though &amp;
pass to all (sorry meant to do that ages ago...).

Apologies if I mistyped any addresses, I thought I'd triple checked
everything, but obviously something was missed, so my bad.

If paperwork can be with Iain, then we could arrange to meet either quickly
tonight (at the space) or tomorrow am before bank (if Iain is free?) -
earlier is best for me, as I'm on call so need to keep my day as clear as I
can.

Iain - please let me know your availability for tomorrow etc &amp; we can get
this done :)


Tony

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Queens cross are open until half one( I think) tomorrow.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There was some talk about coordinating when Andy was available, but at
</I>&gt;<i> this time of day
</I>&gt;<i> I cannot remember if it was a sticking point or not. Either way he is not

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Im sure this is 90% of everything, Carl/Ed can you fill in the blanks I
