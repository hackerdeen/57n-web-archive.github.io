That was probably me. My point was that we didn't want Calum to just
come in one day and take the 42U rack away leaving us with a mess of
previously racked equipment all over the space.

&gt;<i> In all seriousness, longer term it's not going to hurt us to pop a
</I>&gt;<i> clarification on the wiki regarding items left outside of boxes, but I'm
</I>&gt;<i> hoping this is just a case of cross wires somewhere.
</I>
This is a special case, because it's infrastructure of the space, not
just a project. The whole space becomes disadvantaged if Calum comes in
and removes it.

We should get some documentation up on the wiki about these things
though. I would have it say something along the lines of the following:

(a) If equipment is installed outside of the space to form
infrastructure for the space, it will be considered property of 57North
Hacklab and be available for use by all members as long as that use does
not impair the use of other members.
(b) If a project is in progress that requires equipment larger than can
reasonably be placed into your storage box, for either volume or mass
reasons, it may be stored under a standing desk as long as it is not
inconveniencing other members. This storage should be considered
short-term unless the project is really cool.
(c) If you are unclear, email <A HREF="http://lists.57north.co/listinfo/57north-ctte">57north-ctte at lists.57north.co</A> for
clarification.

&gt;<i> Did anyone seriously say to him that any item left in the space is
</I>&gt;<i> considered hackspace property?
</I>
I didn't say that, I just said that if he is going to have the 42U rack
in replacing the 24U rack then it should at least be in the space on the
same or better terms as the 24U rack in that it will remain in the space
for as long there is a space unless superseded. Saying that, I don't
want the 24U rack back and I consider it to be property of 57North
Hacklab now.

&gt;<i> Because if so, I'd like it on record that I consider that to be a really
</I>&gt;<i> silly idea, as it will discourage anyone from ever loaning us stuff.
</I>
Maybe it's best if people don't loan us stuff, especially infrastructure
stuff. Just sayin'.

Iain.
