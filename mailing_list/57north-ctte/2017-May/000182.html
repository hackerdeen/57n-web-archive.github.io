I approve of getting the accountant to prepare the books @ £500 max cost.

Normal procedure would have the accounts needing to be approved by the
board before they are submitted. Last year that power was delegated to
the treasurer (though looking at it now I noticed that that delegation
wasn't actually valid as it didn't specify the required time period
for the validity of that power being delegated... probably best to
gloss over that). We have collective responsibility for the accounts
being correct so I'd rather we ahve a board meeting to go over them
before they are submitted. At the very least we need a board meeting
to (properly...) delegate responsibility/power to approve them.

If I were to ask you to dance naked for me, would your answer be the
same as to this question?
