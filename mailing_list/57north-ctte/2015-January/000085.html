Assuming it isn't too expensive (say less that &#163;20): I approve of this
plan.

All approvals of spending need to happen at a board meeting or with
signed emails from directors to this list. 

At a board meeting normal voting/quorum rules for the meeting apply. 

On the list we need a minimum of 2 directors to approve any spending,
in which case 7 calendar days need to be allowed for objections to be
raised. 

If 3 or more directors chime in with approvals there can no longer be
a majority objecting so it is then approved. 

Assuming I set up mutt to use GPG properly this should take us to the
minimum approval so it'll be approved in a week (unless there are
objections) or when someone else adds an approval.

I think...

Robert
