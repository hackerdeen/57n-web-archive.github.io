<PRE>Alright Crew, what are we going to do about this one? 

16th April? Tuesday? We can do a pre-announce message asking for motions to be tabled and then follow up with a 2 week announcement a week tomorrow.

Cheers,
DH

&gt;<i> Hello All
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am freee on the 2nd March for the AGM, but as there is a gig on that night, could we propose another night, I will be available all that week no I don't have any preference and would leave it to others with commitments
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am happy to try running other night, just term time I am generally busy and have a hard time committing, having a meetings for the air quality sensors in the space sounds good, I'll float that with the group.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; On the point of the other nights thing, You're right. At the moment we are working more as a social club who meets on a tuesday that people pay to be in than a general community ownedlab.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We did have the weekly AE monday session for quieter project work which I ran, but I stopped as I a) don't have the time and effort to run something weekly and b) it ended up being either me or me and derecho, and it's a bit disheartening when it's just you week-in week-out, but I'm happy to send out a weekly / fortnightly email advertising a quiet projects night along the same lines. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Carl used to quite regularly run Hackerday Saturday and Themed Thursday too.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; People have in general fallen out of the habit of emailing if they're coming in, we probably need to stimulate that a little, but perhaps not by preaching to -discuss as there's quite a lot of noise on that currently. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Perhaps your suggested approach is right irl, we could run a quick strawpoll for an alternative, project driven night, or see if there's any nights that we want to run as a group on a regular basis. Maybe a different event every thursday of the month - Cryptonoise, harware hackers, music boxes and air quality monitoring group, for example. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The issue then is finding people to run the nights in our small, already somewhat stretched pool of organisers...
