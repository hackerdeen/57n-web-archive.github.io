</I>&gt;<i> Announcement Email Draft

</I>&gt;<i> Subject: Annual General Meeting
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Dear members (apologies if you receive this twice via the cross-post)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 57 North Hacklab Ltd. Will be holding our Annual General Meeting (AGM)
</I>&gt;<i> at 19:30 on Tuesday the 23rd of April 2019 in the Hacklab's social room,
</I>&gt;<i> Lower Floors, 26 North Silver Street, Aberdeen. AB10 1RL.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Much of the procedure for the AGM is laid out in the articles of
</I>&gt;<i> association which can be obtained from Companies House.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Our current membership count is 22, a quarter of 22 is 5.5 (rounded to 6)
</I>&gt;<i> which is more than 5 so quorum for the meeting will require 5 members
</I>&gt;<i> (see Article 44).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The AGM is intended to be a check that we are sticking to our legal
</I>&gt;<i> requirements rather than going through the day to day running of the
</I>&gt;<i> space (issues about the day to day running would be better raised on
</I>&gt;<i> the discuss mailing list).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Agenda for the meeting:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Election of meeting chair
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Report on activities since last AGM
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Treasurer's report
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Election of directors
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Vote on the resolution to update the articles of association to
</I>&gt;<i>   direct surplus assets to members should the hackerspace wind-up
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Any Other Competent Business
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We are now accepting nominations for anyone who wishes to stand for
</I>&gt;<i> election as a director for the next year. Nominations can be made by
</I>&gt;<i> sending an email to 57north-announce at lists.57north.co stating that you
</I>&gt;<i> would like to stand (and some explanation of why) before the meeting
</I>&gt;<i> or by indicating that you want to stand when we get to that part of
</I>&gt;<i> the meeting.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The details of how the election of directors will be conducted will be
</I>&gt;<i> up to whoever is elected to chair the meeting (Articles 48, 51 and 52)
</I>&gt;<i> but will probably be something along the lines of: if we have less
</I>&gt;<i> than 5 candidates more nominations will be sought until we get to 5 or
</I>&gt;<i> more candidates.  If we have exactly 5 candidates at the AGM then they
</I>&gt;<i> will become the new board. If we have more than 5 candidates then
</I>&gt;<i> we'll have an election to decide who gets to be a director -
</I>&gt;<i> previously [0] we've done this with via opavote.org.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If any member can't make the meeting there are a couple of things they
</I>&gt;<i> can do to participate should they wish to.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Any issues you'd like to have raised at the meeting can be sent to
</I>&gt;<i> 57north-discuss at lists.57north.co or privately to any of the directors
</I>&gt;<i> or to the directors collectively at 57north-ctte-private at lists.57north.co
</I>&gt;<i> (please make it clear you are sending something you want raised at the
</I>&gt;<i> AGM) and we will see that it is brought up.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A proxy can be appointed to vote on your behalf at the meeting (see
</I>&gt;<i> Articles 47, 53 and 54). If you would like to appoint a
</I>&gt;<i> proxy please send an email to 57north-ctte-private at lists.57north.co
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Email sent to the 57north-ctte-private address is redirected to all
</I>&gt;<i> presently listed directors and is not archived by 57North Hacklab (but
</I>&gt;<i> may be by the individual directors).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The email (preferably PGP signed, with a key trusted by the directors to
</I>&gt;<i> be yours) should contain:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Your name and address (as it appears in the register of members
</I>&gt;<i>   on hackhub)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - Who you would like to appoint as a proxy
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - That this is for the AGM on 23rd of April 2019
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - If you have any specifications for how the proxy is to act on your
</I>&gt;<i>   behalf.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The proxy should bring the same details to the meeting on paper and
</I>&gt;<i> signed by the member they are to act as a proxy for.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Remote participation in our meetings is allowed. If anyone who
</I>&gt;<i> can't make it to the meeting would like to participate remotely, we can
</I>&gt;<i> set up a conference call and/or Skype call for the meeting. Any members who
</I>&gt;<i> would like to connect via one of these channels should let me know - it
</I>&gt;<i> will not be set this up unless demand for it is communicated to me. If
</I>&gt;<i> anyone has a different preference for how they would like to participate
</I>&gt;<i> remotely, let me know and I'll see what can be done.
