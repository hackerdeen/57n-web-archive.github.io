Hi Iain. Thanks for the comment.

Tuesday was picked as AGM day as it a date most already have in their
calender. As we now have two and a half rooms, it seemed like a good idea.

Having said that, I have just checked and I see there is a performance
taking place that eve from 7pm in the ajoining music venue, so that would
be a good reason to either bump it to another date or another venue.

The Thursday (25th) is a cryptonoise night - am I correct? It is the last
Thurs of the month.

Cheers,
Nordin
