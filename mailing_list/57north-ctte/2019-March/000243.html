<PRE>There's a decent chance I'm not going to to be around the space much
going forward. Before I actually disappear I wanted to make some effort
to hand off stuff I've been looking after. Even if my plans change and I
don't disappear it's useful to check/fix the bus factor.

I've had a look through the list of stuff on the Infrastructure page and
I think it's up to date for the stuff I've been dealing with.
<A HREF="https://wiki.57north.org.uk/index.php/Infrastructure">https://wiki.57north.org.uk/index.php/Infrastructure</A>

I think other people should have access to all of the systems that make
up our infrastructure, but please check that.

Especially need to check doorbot; I think hibby's might be the only
other key added there at the moment.

The connection between hackhub (on finzean) and doorbot currently relies
on them both being on my VPN. It's been on the TODO list since I set up
doorbot at the new space to move that to something entirely on space
infrastructure. Could really do with someone actually doing that now.

I am currently down as the BitFolk contact. Should switch that over to
someone(s) else. I thought other people had access to manage the account
there (panel.bitfolk.com) but I don't see it in the version of the
password DB I have here (I think that's the last version I have access
to, but *shrug*). Can anyone else log in there?

Otherwise anything you think I'm working on for the space: I'm
not. Sorting out the laser cutter comes to mind there but there might be
other things I've said I'd do at some point that I'm not remembering
now.

I'm happy to help with handing stuff over if needed but other than that
I'm mostly going to be filing space related stuff as Not My Problemâ„¢. I
might still help if/when I can but I'm not going to think I'm
responsible for anything related to the space anymore.

Robert

You'll feel much better once you've given up all hope.
