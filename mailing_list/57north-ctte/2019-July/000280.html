Ok, so the communication between 57N and the science center could have
been better.

If the other directors wanted to be a pain (which I think is unlikely,
but it's possible) they could refuse to authorise this. We shouldn't be
in a situation where money has already been spent without ensuring that
it's going to be reimbursed.

Thanks,
Iain.
