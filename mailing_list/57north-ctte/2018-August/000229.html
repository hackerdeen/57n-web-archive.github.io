<PRE>Hello All,

I can say I approve this but I m receiving the money so I may be seen as having a conflict.

To Hibby, Andy could you approve this if you are happy with it, and I can claim the costs.

&gt;<i> Dear Directors. I am seeking director approval for expendature for the
</I>&gt;<i> second fit of the new hackerspace. This is for second-fit items
</I>&gt;<i> purchased by Kev, namely the consumer unit, MCBs, Brackets, Trunking
</I>&gt;<i> and sundries. This amounts to £245.17 (The first fit spend was £193).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Treasurers Mini report
</I>&gt;<i> **************************
</I>&gt;<i> as of Tues 7th Aug 2018:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The bank account stands at £1,101.26. Augusts rent (£325) has yet to
</I>&gt;<i> be paid but will come out within the week as the electronic standing
</I>&gt;<i> order is currently being arranged with the landlord.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This makes the mid-August figure to be £776.26, of which £310 is
</I>&gt;<i> August's early membership income to-date (as recieved between Aug 1st
</I>&gt;<i> and 7th)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The space bank account will stand at £531.09 after the second fit is
</I>&gt;<i> reimbused and August rent paid. Deducting the £310 gives us a rolling
</I>&gt;<i> account surplus amount of £221.09 currently.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Our average expenditure (excluding accountant fees) is £330 and we
</I>&gt;<i> have averaged an income of £303/mnth over the past 3 months (May,
</I>&gt;<i> June, July) based on the recorded figures. NOTE: This average figure
</I>&gt;<i> is somewhat skewed lower by an absent but pending £40 from July cash
</I>&gt;<i> takings what has yet to be offically recieved. Our account surplus is
</I>&gt;<i> £261.09 and avg income is £317/Mnth with it included.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i> Treasuring Co-Director Nordin.
