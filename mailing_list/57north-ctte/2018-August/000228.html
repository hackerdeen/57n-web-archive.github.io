<PRE>Dear Directors. I am seeking director approval for expendature for the
second fit of the new hackerspace. This is for second-fit items
purchased by Kev, namely the consumer unit, MCBs, Brackets, Trunking
and sundries. This amounts to £245.17 (The first fit spend was £193).

Treasurers Mini report
**************************
as of Tues 7th Aug 2018:

The bank account stands at £1,101.26. Augusts rent (£325) has yet to
be paid but will come out within the week as the electronic standing
order is currently being arranged with the landlord.

This makes the mid-August figure to be £776.26, of which £310 is
August's early membership income to-date (as recieved between Aug 1st
and 7th)

The space bank account will stand at £531.09 after the second fit is
reimbused and August rent paid. Deducting the £310 gives us a rolling
account surplus amount of £221.09 currently.

Our average expenditure (excluding accountant fees) is £330 and we
have averaged an income of £303/mnth over the past 3 months (May,
June, July) based on the recorded figures. NOTE: This average figure
is somewhat skewed lower by an absent but pending £40 from July cash
takings what has yet to be offically recieved. Our account surplus is
£261.09 and avg income is £317/Mnth with it included.

Thanks,
Treasuring Co-Director Nordin.
</PRE>
