<PRE>Hi,

Now that some of the trunking is up, we looked at structured cabling
yesterday. While we don't know exactly where the downstairs distribution
rack will go, we do know that we need more CAT6 in order to make the
length of the runs.

Amazon quotes £43.99 for 305m of CAT6 UTP. This should be sufficient for
the main room along with the 80m I dropped off yesterday, and then leave
leftovers for the workshop area and maybe even a couple of interlinks
upstairs.

Amazon quotes between £50 and £70 for a wallmount 4U rack. This should
go downstairs and would probably just have patch panels for the sockets,
a switch and perhaps later anything else running over the CAT6 (e.g. an
ATA or something working with HDMI or whatever).

We don't need to buy the rack now, we just need to know where it's going
and leave enough cable that we can sensibly terminate it onto a patch
panel to go in the rack.

Thanks,
Iain.
</PRE>
