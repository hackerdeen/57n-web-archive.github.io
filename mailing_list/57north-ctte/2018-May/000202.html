<PRE>Dear Directors.

The deposit for the new space was paid yesterday and receipt issued.
We can now look to fitting, sorting and moving items between spaces.
The new location is still full of the existing contents - chairs etc
and practically an entire catering kitchen setup. One additional item
Andrew requested was keycard access (or whatever we use when we add
access) from the street side door in to the stairwell. I spoke that I
did not see an issue with that but would check with directors.

Andrew has offered us anything we want to keep and to my mind at least
one useful thing is that looks like an instant hot water dispenser. I
have offered my time to assist him with junking the contents (he has a
van and a place to dump the junk I am assuming) and of course if
anyone else is able to assist that would help greatly. We may also
want to keep some existing basement tables/chairs but we'll know more
once I have met Sheena this Saturday at noon to go over our current
space inventory. I am also waiting on dates when Andrew's van will be
available.

Now we have firmer footing, it might be a good time to make an
announcement to the list(s) about the next steps I imagine. Anyone
planning an email for that?

Kind regards,
Treasuring Co-Director Nordin
</PRE>
