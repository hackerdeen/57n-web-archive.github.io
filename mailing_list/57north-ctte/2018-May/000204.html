<PRE>Good stuff. So between May13th and May20th (After we have minified
space stuff but before we have complete refitting), are we neatly
stacking items in temp areas e.g. upstairs area/basement under-stair
nook, then retrieving items when ready?

If so, I am moved to start a subsection 'Temporary storage planning'
and reserve locations to get an idea of what we can fit in without
impacting the refit.

&gt;<i> Yeah, good work.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We need to get our current space tidied out - is it worth having a throwout/sell everything party this weekend or a weeknight or two next week? Perhaps a Monday/Tuesday so there are hands to help.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We have some cruft we don't need to carry with us, and plenty stuff to pack away - is it worth going through that now to catalogue what we're moving and what we're chucking, or do we pack everything away, move it and then throw some of it out?
</I>&gt;<i> Once we know what sheena wants to keep, we can clear those out first, then move to packing and seeing what else we can get rid of.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We definitely need to look at packing and moving stuff in the next 10-15 days.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In terms of designing the new space, Kev wants to go in to look at it to think about fitout/electrics, and Peter really wants to drop by to look at the fire doors.  There is a list on a pad [0], linked on the wiki in the timeline[1] about questions to think about next time someone is in there. Contributions are very welcome
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Once Kev's been in, we can have a better idea of what the basic fitout is going to cost, start talking about fundrasing and then let Iain continue to talk about lights [2].
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> An email to the list regarding timescales and buildup activities is probably due.
</I>&gt;<i> Regarding that, I've got a loose timescale on the wiki [1]. My idea was mostly that we get the base of a design &amp; layout agreed by the end of this month, and build a required list of materials based on that. After me telling him his first effort was shit, Iain's made a decent go at it for lighting [2], so it shouldn't be too laborious.
</I>&gt;<i> In June, we (buy and) build it up in stages on Tuesday/other nights, which are loosely detailed on the wiki. Ideally by being able to say &quot;this week is electrical wiring wiring, we need this list of kit &quot; we can collect hardware or financial donations to make it happen. It also avoids us collecting deposits **now** when we'll have to move them and lose them in the future.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Alas, I am away every May weekend and for the entirety of June, so my assistance outside planning and coordination is limited!

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We can now look to fitting, sorting and moving items between spaces.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The new location is still full of the existing contents - chairs etc

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Andrew requested was keycard access (or whatever we use when we add

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> did not see an issue with that but would check with directors.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Andrew has offered us anything we want to keep and to my mind at least
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> one useful thing is that looks like an instant hot water dispenser. I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> have offered my time to assist him with junking the contents (he has a

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> anyone else is able to assist that would help greatly. We may also
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> want to keep some existing basement tables/chairs but we'll know more
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> once I have met Sheena this Saturday at noon to go over our current
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> space inventory. I am also waiting on dates when Andrew's van will be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> available.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Now we have firmer footing, it might be a good time to make an

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> planning an email for that?
