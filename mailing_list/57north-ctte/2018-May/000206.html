<PRE>Hi,

The Wiki has a very incomplete list of Tools that we have. It would be
great if we could catalogue (not necessarily using the wiki in this way,
but even just as a table) everything so that we can fill these details
out on the wiki later.

&gt;<i> In June, we (buy and) build it up in stages on Tuesday/other nights, which are loosely detailed on the wiki. Ideally by being able to say &quot;this week is electrical wiring wiring, we need this list of kit &quot; we can collect hardware or financial donations to make it happen. It also avoids us collecting deposits **now** when we'll have to move them and lose them in the future.
</I>
We should probably point out that money is more useful than having
members going and buying things themselves and donating them unless the
member is the person that's been planning a particular thing. Still, we
would take donations of &quot;stuff&quot; if it's stuff that people already have
spare.

Thanks,
Iain.
