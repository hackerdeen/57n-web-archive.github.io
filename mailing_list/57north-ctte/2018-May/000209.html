Sure or quick link from the table footer to a pirate pad list might be
better for drafting concurrently - then update the proper wiki table when
fully populated and redacted of stuff we are throwing out - both good.
Going forward aye this should be kept more updated, with statuses and
advisories etc.

</I>
If the buying/fitting is coordinated - its just an efficient way of getting
essential tasks done. I would say to anyone considering buying something
direct to help the space that they check with a couple of directors first
to make sure its not duplicated or low-priorly verses other things.
