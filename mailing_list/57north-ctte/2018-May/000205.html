<PRE>Yeah. I think we have to get everything that we're moving and stack it in a temporary location - I figured either the upstairs room or the workshop area.

If we're clever we can avoid duplicating work - for example, in the NewSpace(tm) I'd really like bigger tools to be stored in labelled boxes in the Workshop Area - i.e a box containing Pillar Drills or a box containing Soldering Stations (complete). If we do that in the current space as part of the move, they can be slotted in and forgotten about for the time being - hence the tools section on the wiki! 

Ideally for our 'grand opening' on July 1st, we want to have the main social room open, fitted out and ready for use, probably the workshop room and the upstairs room can be a future issue.

As it goes, I have a single person computer desk and kev said he has one too, so we can, at the very least, get network and desks upstairs. Future goals. 

Are we going to be able to keep the chairs that are currently there? If so I'd really like to hold on to about 20 (?) of them? This way we won't have to buy seats when we move...

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yeah, good work.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We need to get our current space tidied out - is it worth having a throwout/sell everything party this weekend or a weeknight or two next week? Perhaps a Monday/Tuesday so there are hands to help.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We have some cruft we don't need to carry with us, and plenty stuff to pack away - is it worth going through that now to catalogue what we're moving and what we're chucking, or do we pack everything away, move it and then throw some of it out?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Once we know what sheena wants to keep, we can clear those out first, then move to packing and seeing what else we can get rid of.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We definitely need to look at packing and moving stuff in the next 10-15 days.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In terms of designing the new space, Kev wants to go in to look at it to think about fitout/electrics, and Peter really wants to drop by to look at the fire doors.  There is a list on a pad [0], linked on the wiki in the timeline[1] about questions to think about next time someone is in there. Contributions are very welcome
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Once Kev's been in, we can have a better idea of what the basic fitout is going to cost, start talking about fundrasing and then let Iain continue to talk about lights [2].
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; An email to the list regarding timescales and buildup activities is probably due.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Regarding that, I've got a loose timescale on the wiki [1]. My idea was mostly that we get the base of a design &amp; layout agreed by the end of this month, and build a required list of materials based on that. After me telling him his first effort was shit, Iain's made a decent go at it for lighting [2], so it shouldn't be too laborious.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; In June, we (buy and) build it up in stages on Tuesday/other nights, which are loosely detailed on the wiki. Ideally by being able to say &quot;this week is electrical wiring wiring, we need this list of kit &quot; we can collect hardware or financial donations to make it happen. It also avoids us collecting deposits **now** when we'll have to move them and lose them in the future.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Alas, I am away every May weekend and for the entirety of June, so my assistance outside planning and coordination is limited!

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; The deposit for the new space was paid yesterday and receipt issued.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; We can now look to fitting, sorting and moving items between spaces.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; The new location is still full of the existing contents - chairs etc
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; and practically an entire catering kitchen setup. One additional item
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Andrew requested was keycard access (or whatever we use when we add
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; access) from the street side door in to the stairwell. I spoke that I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; did not see an issue with that but would check with directors.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Andrew has offered us anything we want to keep and to my mind at least
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; one useful thing is that looks like an instant hot water dispenser. I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; have offered my time to assist him with junking the contents (he has a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; van and a place to dump the junk I am assuming) and of course if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; anyone else is able to assist that would help greatly. We may also
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; want to keep some existing basement tables/chairs but we'll know more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; once I have met Sheena this Saturday at noon to go over our current
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; space inventory. I am also waiting on dates when Andrew's van will be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; available.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Now we have firmer footing, it might be a good time to make an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; announcement to the list(s) about the next steps I imagine. Anyone
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; planning an email for that?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Kind regards,
