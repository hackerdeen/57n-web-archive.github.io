<PRE>Dear 57north member

As a followup to my previous email, the board will be meet at 1830 on
Friday the 26th of September 2014, at the space to enact dismemberment
procedure. On the agenda with be any petitions to the board from members
facing dismemberment, followed by the actual dismemberment of members. If
you like to submit your petition but cannot make the meeting, please email
me or any of the other directors.

It's a sad truth, but life tends to get in the way of hacking; that said a
little distraction amongst a huddle of geeks
&lt;<A HREF="http://bodaegl.ormiret.com/foo/57N-people.gif">http://bodaegl.ormiret.com/foo/57N-people.gif</A>&gt; is generally a good thing.
It's worth mentioning that the space runs an 'busy hacker' amnesty for
members that are away from the space for an extended period. This means
that returning members only need to additionally pay for one month prior
their returning month to retain membership benefits.

Lastly, please consider taking the 57north community survey
&lt;<A HREF="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1SmzhLikWnfl5UugIxAjoPaDhS3Eu3XCn5I2oViILoNg/viewform?usp=send_form">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1SmzhLikWnfl5UugIxAjoPaDhS3Eu3XCn5I2oViILoNg/viewform?usp=send_form</A>&gt;
if you haven't already - we truly value your feedback.

Kind regards,

Ed (aka Nordin)
Director and treasurer,
45North.co

Subject: Updating 57north member lists

Dear 57north member

We hope this email finds you well.

Maintaining accurate member lists are an essential part of any successful
hackerspace. Our records indicate that your last 57north membership payment
was more than 2 months ago. This is a courtesy email to inform you that, as
per article 22 of the 57north Articles of Association, a resolution for
dismemberment of nonpaying members will be proposed at an upcoming
directors meeting.

We sincerely hope you will consider resuming paid membership, but should
you wish to withdraw membership in advance of automatic dismemberment,
please email the directors at <A HREF="http://lists.57north.co/listinfo/57north-ctte">57north-ctte-private at 57north.co</A> (non-public)
stating your intent to withdraw. If you believe you are receiving this
notice in error, please contact me directly.

Regardless of your membership status or intent, we invite you to take our
membership survey soon to be emailed out. We would very much like learn of
any feedback you have to offer.

Kind regards,

Ed Watson
Director and Treasurer,
57north.co
