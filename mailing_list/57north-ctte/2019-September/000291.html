<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>The 57North board plan to hold a board meeting on Tuesday 24th
September, 2019, 7pm. The location will be the space social room and
all are invited. It is hoped the meeting will be short (approx 30
mins) but if the room is in use by non-attending members who wish for
quiet over the planned duration, we will relocate to a nearby
location.

According to the articles we should do our best to provide 7 days
notice for a board meeting unless there is deemed an urgent need to
meet. Following the upcoming loss of our current space location, a
temporary cost-effective alternative location has been found at an
office complex in the Bridge of Don area [1]. After exchanging
details, the building rep has now confirmed we can take it on if we
want it, so an urgent decision is now required.

The meeting agenda is solely to decide on the best action regarding
the proposed next space location. Following a very recent and short
email from our current landlord, we may now be able to stay a max of 2
additional months but it is not clear what conditions are attached.
More information is sought and an update will be provided on Tuesday.
After passing any updates and taking input from the floor, the board
will vote to take on the new location before the end of the month.

Kind regards,
Ed

Treasuring Director,
57North.
