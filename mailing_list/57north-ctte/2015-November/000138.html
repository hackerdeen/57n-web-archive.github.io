<PRE>Sorry I should have added that this is for 10 kits/people and does not
include useful spares or larger tool upgrades. We might also consider
adding some equipment and/or materials to the costings to help us host the
builds (e.g. more storage) or perhaps to produce some marketing materials
to get the word out.

Cheers,
Ed

My idea. See attached - app form and costings breakdown.

Tl;DR
1) We advertise a Kossel Mini 3D printer kit and 2months space membership
for &#163;100
2) Directors select from applicants using an agreed criteria based on the
people, their plans and aspirations
3) Aberdeen Council contributes &#163;100 to the kit (&#163;200 in total) and 2x &#163;20
for 2mths membership per person.
4) We print/locally source kit items as we can
5) We offer build support and host 1 day-a-week sessions as printer
workshops
6) We teach some basics of 3D design towards the end
7) After 2 months, they can either join up or switch to visitors (but can
no longer store their items in the space.

also finally.. only if we want to make a splash...
8) They can 3D scan their face via a phone app and then print themselves as
a tile. This is just a end-goal concept to motivate and can be dropped if
not feasible. I am working on a prototype using the Autodesk's 123D
photo-to-3D just to try it out. The name branding is intended to work on 3
levels: 'You are 3D Printing', 'You will print yourself' and '3D Printing
University' :)

Ultimately, we give some lower-income creatives a super neat tool and show
them how to care for it / use it along with a support network, whilst also
building our community and fundraising. Variations include a subgroup of
fully subsidised kit enrolments or increasing the months of membership
included.

Feel free to rip it apart and correct if needed. Sections 5.4 and 6 need
input. Also, perhaps check my logic in the spreadsheet.

Cheers,
Nordin
