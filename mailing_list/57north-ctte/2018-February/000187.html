<PRE>We are supposed to have the AGM in April. Need to send announcement at least 14 days before it. For the start of April that would have to be going out in about a fortnight. 

Anybody have any preference for when in April we have the AGM?

We have in the past had a round of dismembering people who're behind on dues to tidy up the member list before the AGM. There are a few folk on the chopping block ATM <A HREF="https://hub.57north.org.uk/hub/admin/behind">https://hub.57north.org.uk/hub/admin/behind</A>

Need to send them a reminder and then have a board meeting to pass dismemberment. Need minimum of 7 days notice for that (preferably more to give me time to get organised to actually send emails to people - unless someone else want's to volunteer to do that?). 

How does everyone's availability for a board meeting look starting about a week from now? I think I'll be in Prague next week, but could probably join remotely if it looks like sometime then works best for the rest of you.
