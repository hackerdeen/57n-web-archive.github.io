Hey Carl,

Again, Congratulations about the new job. We spoke on Friday and it
sounds like it is going to be a great move for you. Shame it is so far
away.

I think that it makes the most sense to have you direct remotely until
we cycle naturally. I don't think there are any procedural issues, Rob
will probably know if there are.

It has been great having you as both a member of the space and a
director for these two and a half years. You will be missed every
Tuesday night for a long time.
