Congratulations on the new job. What are you going to be doing?

Standing down at the AGM (or rather not standing for re-election, since
all directors vacate office then anyway) should be fine. Only real
change would be us looking to get 3 out of 4 rather than 3 out of 5 to
hit quorum for a board meeting, but that shouldn't be a problem.  

Our register of directors is supposed to have a current address for the
current directors so when you move could you please figure out
what/where our register of directors is and see that it gets updated
appropriately.
