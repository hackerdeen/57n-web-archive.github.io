&gt;<i> Draft of the director's report for tomorrow below. Anything I've missed
</I>&gt;<i> or got wrong? Anyone want to put in something for what was done at the
</I>&gt;<i> events?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;report&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> ** Membership
</I>&gt;<i> We currently have 31 members. This is up 6 from the last AGM. We haven't
</I>&gt;<i> had any members officially leave over the last year but there are some
</I>&gt;<i> where we haven't seen them (or their money) for a while. Tidying that up
</I>&gt;<i> will be on the TODO list for the new board.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Over the last 6 months (15/10 to 16/3) we averaged 15 and a third
</I>&gt;<i> members paying each month.
</I>&gt;<i> ** Changes to the space
</I>&gt;<i> we haven't actually changed much over the last year - either we've got
</I>&gt;<i> the space to a point where it's working or everyone has just given up.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We have gotten some new tools and have gotten rid of some of the junk
</I>&gt;<i> that's been cluttering up the space for ages.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We raised pledges to purchase a 3D printer kit in September 2015. That
</I>&gt;<i> printer has now been assembled, and modified a bit, and is available for
</I>&gt;<i> use.
</I>&gt;<i> ** New space?
</I>&gt;<i> We have investigated a couple of possibilities for places to move the
</I>&gt;<i> space to. As yet we haven't found anything we can afford that would be
</I>&gt;<i> an improvement on the current space.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The search is ongoing; if anyone has any leads please do let us know.
</I>&gt;<i> ** Places we went
</I>&gt;<i> Some of our members have been out and about flying the 57N flag at
</I>&gt;<i> events.
</I>&gt;<i> *** CCCamp
</I>&gt;<i> *** CCCongress
</I>&gt;<i> *** Edinburgh Mini Maker Faire
</I>&gt;<i> ** Meetings
</I>&gt;<i> Our last AGM was on the 16th of April 2015.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since then we have had one director's meeting, on the 11th of November
</I>&gt;<i> 2015. This meeting was to approve our accounts for the period up to 28th
</I>&gt;<i> February 2015 so they could be submitted to the appropriate authorities.
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/report&gt;
