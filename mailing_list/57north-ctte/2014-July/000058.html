It's a requirement of RBS, not of our articles, that we had this board
meeting.

&gt;<i> I also have the view that as the person to collect membership from members

This is a good point. I'm sure it is possible to add you to the list of
authorised users later on though. It was important to just get it set up
initially.

&gt;<i> I hope that this will be discussed further.

As stated in the ammended note, we could defer the submission of the forms
until after Friday if there are strong objections. This would delay the
application process. Otherwise, I'd be happy to agree that you are added to
the list of authorised users, and I'm almost certain there would be no
objection from the other directors, at the earliest oppertunity.

For now, I could send you exports from the online banking once I have access
in order to do the membership things.

Iain.
