<PRE>Hi Rob,

Could you generate some membership reports from the database for me.

I need a list of Hackerdeen members that haven't been in since the formation of
the company. And members that are no longer in good standing. I think the
following two sets of criteria match what I am trying to find.

Members that paid before March 2014, but not since.
Members that did not pay May and June 2014 and are yet to pay July 2014.

I have cc'd the committee list so the board(and interested parties) can follow
what I am looking at. Please don't send these two reports to any public list.
