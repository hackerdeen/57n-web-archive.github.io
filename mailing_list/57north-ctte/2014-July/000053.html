Board Meeting - 13th July 2014
------------------------------

Present:
  Edward Watson (Chair)
  Tom Jones
  Iain Learmonth (Recording Minutes)

1. Access to online banking

  A unanimous majority approves Edward Watson and Iain Learmonth
  applying for access to online banking for the purpose of checking
  standing order payments.

  Action - Iain Learmonth - Complete online banking application

NOTE - This meeting was called by Edward Watson without the 7 days
notice period required by article 80 as we have started to collect
standing order payments and require a means to verify them and therefore
it was felt that there was enough urgency to forego this notice period.
