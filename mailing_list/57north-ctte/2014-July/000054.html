You have got to be kidding me!?

We put up the bank details for the standing orders a month ago, after
quite a lot of discussion about how to handle them (we've been
discussing standing orders since at least the company formation), but
there is now such a sudden urgency for how to handle them that you had
to have a board meeting with zero notice? When there is already one
scheduled for less than a week from now? 

I'm really questioning if I want to continue to be involved with the
space if it's going to be run like this.
