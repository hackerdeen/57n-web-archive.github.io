Howdy Y'all,

These are the minutes for the meeting that we held in June - 

I would have sent them out sooner, but I've been GPG struggling as we've all seen with my complaining in IRC earlier.

Anyway - on with the show, here are the long overdue, signed minutes

Hx

# Board Meeting

Date: 27 June 2019

Location: Under the hammer

Present: Kev, Ed, Hibby, Tom and Andy

Chair: Hibby

Minutes: Andy

Started: 19:08


# Dismemeberment

Discussion about dismemeberment, members who have left / are no-longer paying subs.

Need a process for dismemeberment. Possibly something sending an email notice.  Discussed members avoiding dismenberment by paying 2 months subs, rather than all outstanding.  

Side note from hibby: Paragraph 22 of the articles details our expulsion from membership requirements: 
    
    We must provide a written reminder and then after that remove them.  Ormiret has this automated afaik. 
    There is precedent for this in <A HREF="http://lists.57north.co/pipermail/57north-announce/2017-March/000262.html">http://lists.57north.co/pipermail/57north-announce/2017-March/000262.html</A>
