<PRE>HI all. On the basis that the Kettock Lodge site would at least be a
suitable short-term location, I would like to organise a group visit
to the possible space for those interested in visiting. The biggest
obstacle I can think of is the less-central location and getting
members to comment on this would be useful. Can someone privately pass
over the main contact details for the person who controls the space?

In other news, the landlord at the Union Terrace Gardens office
contacted me yesterday with an offer for the first month rental free
(£400) is we take the place from next week. He'll be putting the
office on the market from Monday which will cost him time and money,
so he has an interest in reaching an early agreement if we wanted to
take it.

Kind regards,
Ed

</I>&gt;<i> Hello Hackers,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I visited the potential space at Kettock Lodge in the Bridge of Don. The
</I>&gt;<i> space would be a sublet from Aberdeen Action on Disability.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I did not take any pictures - there really was no point.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> AAoD have the Southern half of the building as seen on google maps. They
</I>&gt;<i> are not using this space, the office they do use could have easily seat
</I>&gt;<i> 30 people and they have two desks. The room the are offering is on top
</I>&gt;<i> of this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> They are offering us a section in their 'aircraft hanger'. Basically the
</I>&gt;<i> top floor of a building. If you have seen my lab at the uni this space
</I>&gt;<i> is may 4-6 times the size.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The idea would be that we cut out a section for us.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I do not think this is a suitable permanent location for the
</I>&gt;<i> hackerspace. We would have to build walls and even then we would have to
</I>&gt;<i> be much better neighbours than we are right now.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While I don't think it is a good permanent location, AAoD are open to us
</I>&gt;<i> being a tenant temporally, maybe something on the order of 6 months.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right now the Bridge of Don mens shed are storing stuff there, it is
</I>&gt;<i> entirely possible that we can have most of the hackerspace there for a
</I>&gt;<i> few months while we find somewhere else.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We would not be able to have a real sub lease with AAoD, instead I think
</I>&gt;<i> we would get use of the space for a donation to the charity.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I asked about Internet and access, they have a good uplink, but trunk
</I>&gt;<i> cable would need rerouted. We can have door access to the building with
</I>&gt;<i> a code, and maybe 1 key for the actual space.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> - [tj]
