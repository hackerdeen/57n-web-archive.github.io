<PRE>I think this must be cert from an old config/setup. Currently used cert is listing expiry as 27th March.

I'm just going to ignore it, but thought I'd ping it on to here in case anyone else wants to check further to make sure.

Hello,

Your certificate (or certificates) for the names listed below will expire in 20 days (on 26 Jan 20 11:43 +0000). Please make sure to renew your certificate before then, or visitors to your website will encounter errors.

We recommend renewing certificates automatically when they have a third of their
total lifetime left. For Let's Encrypt's current 90-day certificates, that means
renewing 30 days before expiration. See
<A HREF="https://letsencrypt.org/docs/integration-guide/">https://letsencrypt.org/docs/integration-guide/</A> for details.
