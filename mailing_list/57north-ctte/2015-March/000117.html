&gt;<i> We're supposed to have an AGM in April.
</I>&gt;<i> The announcement needs to go out a bit over 2 weeks before the actual

</I>&gt;<i> have to be for the 5th or later and meeting on 30th would have to be
</I>&gt;<i> announced on or before 14th. Any preferences for when we have it?
</I>
Mid-month Thursdays work best for me and seem good days for others
generally. so maybe 16th or 23rd? Suggest we avoid Tues just incase we
get a large attendance + visitors. Mid/end Sats are (my) next
preference, so 18th or 25th?

I cannot do 30th as am moving house.

&gt;<i> Normal business for an AGM is
</I>&gt;<i>  - Report on what's happened since the last AGM from chair.
</I>&gt;<i>  - Treasurer goes through accounts and they get adopted.
</I>&gt;<i>  - Election of directors.
</I>
Other than the standard 'Election of Meeting Chair' and 'AOCB'? no.

&gt;<i> For the Election of directors: I'd suggest that we open nominations
</I>&gt;<i> with the AGM announcement. Then if we only have 5 volunteers come the
</I>&gt;<i> AGM they get to be directors, if there are more than that we kick off
</I>&gt;<i> an election in opavote.
</I>
I would be happy with this.

Cheers,
Ed
