I'm supposed to be elsewhere on 23rd but 16th would be fine. Either of
the Saturdays look fine for me.

That's something else I meant to mention: the chair will have a bit
more to do at an AGM than normal meetings as they should be giving the
report on activities (though they can delegate that if we want to
complicate things). So I'd suggest we pick a chair in advance so that
they can prepare that. Anyone want to volunteer?

lacking zero, they had no way to indicate successful termination of
their C programs.
