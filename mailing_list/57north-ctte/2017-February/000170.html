I've fixed hub to be using the right number of months and fixed the
listing of last payment. 

I am now fairly confident that
<A HREF="https://hub.57north.org.uk/hub/admin/behind">https://hub.57north.org.uk/hub/admin/behind</A> is actually a list of
candidates for dismemberment.

Currently 20 people on the list (4 of them have never paid so aren't
really members...).

I'm thinking send out the emails on Wednesday with whatever the list
looks like once the month ticks over.

Apparently, three out of four people make up 75% of the population.
