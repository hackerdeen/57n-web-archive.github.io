<PRE>TL;DR: I want to have a board meeting to dismember some people between
about 27th Feb and 18th March. What does your availability look like
in that period? Specifically 27th Feb and 14th-16th March (when suits
me best)?

Longer version:
We've got a load of members still on the list who're not around
anymore.
<A HREF="https://hub.57north.org.uk/hub/admin/behind">https://hub.57north.org.uk/hub/admin/behind</A>

Though I'm not sure how much I trust that list since the &quot;Last
payment&quot; part is obviously broken... I'll take a look at it before we
actually start sending out warnings of impending dismemberment.

Clause 22 of the articles is the rule for dismembering people who're
behind paying (and reading it now I think the definition of candidate
for dismemberment in hub is off by a month: dues are due at the end of
the month (clause 20) and have to 2 months past due for dismemberment
under clause 22 so it should be current plus 3 previous months having
no payment).

Only requirement for dismemberment is that we have to send a reminder
to folks first. The articles don't put a timeline on that but I think
it would be best to give a couple of weeks between reminder and
dismemberment, and include when it's going to happen. 

I'd like to get the member list cleaned up before the AGM, which
should be in April. Include notice period before that (you never know
we might be organised enough to want to hold the AGM at the start of
April...) and we want to do the dismembering before about 18th March.

Two weeks notice plus a few days to actually get organised enough to
send the reminder emails puts us to about week beginning 27th Feb.

I'm away from 28th Feb to 9th March, and possibly again 10th-13th and
am busy 17th-19th (that one might have gaps that I could make it to
a meeting but probably wont know when they are far enough in advance
to pick a time that we can actually schedule things). So in that 3
week window there are only 4 days that I could actually make it to a
meeting. How does 27th Feb, 14th 15th or 16th Mar suit the rest of
you? If that doesn't fit I can possibly join remotely or you can have
the meeting without me. Or could push it to later and limit AGM to
further into April.
