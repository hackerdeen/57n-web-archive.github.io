I think I've now spoken to you all and confirmed that 19:30 16th March
works so we will be having a board meeting then.

I'll clean up the list of people who might be dismembered and look to
send reminder emails to them this week. I'm aiming to be organised
enough that you get a draft of that to critique before I send it but I
wouldn't want to bet on that actually happening.
