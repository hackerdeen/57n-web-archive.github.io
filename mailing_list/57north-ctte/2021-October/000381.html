<PRE>Hi gang, 

Shall we have a get together/catchup/etc at some point in the second
half of November?

invite the rest of the 'space, make it a proper committee meeting of
sorts.

I think we need to look at hackhub and/or replacing it with a
spreadsheet, the membership application process, member retention &amp; also
do a round of dismemberment, and probably some other company related
stuff.

Ideally mailing lists will be migrated by then, I am watching irl do it
now and apart from the occasional &quot;ah&quot; things are going well!

I need to find time to waddle down to RBS and speak to them about cards,
online access for business banking and more. I might make some time to
call them this week. I think we should also nominate another signatory
or two on the account - my thoughts are andyg and irl.

I'm open to all ideas, and tbh most of this can be bashed out in a few
emails, but I kinda fancy seeing your faces over a beer to talk shit for
a bit.

Cheers
Hx
</PRE>
