<PRE>Hello All

I'll be in tonight from about 6 and will open the lower door then.

The one thing I would like to do is empty some of the large boxes as I'll have to return them, this can be done in the main room as there is not a lot left to get that ready.

I'll also move some of my tools to the dirty workspace and decide what to do with the stainless table that is in there.

Doc.
