I meant to send this yesterday but got distracted and forgot. 

We now have a working internet connection in the space :)

The remaining problem was that the router was giving out the converged DNS servers from the old space connection via DHCP and they weren't actually reachable from the general internet. I've switched it to google's DNS servers for now (I could remember their IPs). Bikeshedding on what we *should* be using can now commence. Until we have consensus on that if you don't want to use google's DNS: don't trust DHCP for DNS servers when in the space.

The edgerouter and wifi AP are currently on the wall in the corner of the main room. This gives is wifi and a small number (I think 3 available?) of wired ports there. Once the rack is actually installed somewhere they'll be moved there and switch etc. added to give more (and more convenient) wired connections.  No idea when that'll happen - my level of caring about the wired network puts it below quite a lot of other stuff on the TODO list for me, so won't be soon unless someone else does it.
