<PRE>Hi

I can come down today and help with cable pulling, if that'd help,  free
from 9-3.  I don't really know too much about the plans, but happy to
assist.

I was wondering if we could run it down the dumb waiter shaft, in some
ways, and if that'd save going through floors, though it'd probably mean
more walls.

Looking at <A HREF="https://wiki.57north.org.uk/index.php/EngageSpace/Network">https://wiki.57north.org.uk/index.php/EngageSpace/Network</A> seems
like just high level info.

Cheers

Andy

</I>&gt;<i> Nah, that's sounds like *way* too much effort. :) You buy professional
