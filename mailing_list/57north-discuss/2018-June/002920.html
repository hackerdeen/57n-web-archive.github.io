<PRE>Hi all  - Quick update on the space buildout and some musings on fostering
involvement.

We have kept a running update on actions taken by those who have
volunteered to do works. Check out the wiki for more information [1].

As you may know, members have been meeting up on Tues over June for
discussions and actions on plans posted up. I would like to encourage
members or visitors who have not been able to attend to send any
comments/concerns about our changes either to me in private if they wish or
via the public lists. Wiki photos are up-to-date as of the weekend.
Otherwise feel free to visit the space this Tues - I promise you'll only be
assigned tasks if you want them!, otherwise feel free to sit, drink and
comment on that craftsmanship :)

Our Tuesday buildout meetings have overseen a large number of things done -
the goal being a comfortable environment for typical open Tuesdays to take
place from July. We are gearing up to our first official Open Tuesday in
the new space on July 3rd and we hope you will join us then too.

Over the buildout, the fostering of involvement [2] has been strained given
our stated timeline, and wiki and email updates may not have captured all
discussions had. We should always be open to ideas of how to do this better
and post-move is a good time to maybe tweak this. Physically the space is a
lot more accessible now, so that's something. In terms of process, there
are a number of different ways to run a hackerspace and we probably cannot
claim ours is the best. As with the above, commentary and discourse on this
is welcome either publicly or  publically. Gathering some primary research
into how other hackerspaces manage just might be my personal EMF camp
project so do pass on any contacts you have that might be keen to share. It
would be a great excuse to be chatty to folk at EMF camp.

Cheers,
Nordin.

[2] On Fostering Involvement: Participation grows personal buy-in when it
comes to community, which increases repeat participation - or
'Involvement'.  Of those who would like to become more equally involved,
not all can equally participate in the existing ways i.e. some are busy,
have accessibility concerns, live away etc, or just have competing
interests. Particularly in hackerspaces, it is also difficult to catalogue
and disseminate all the organic in-person discussions and group decisions
that grow in physical meetings - but nor would we wish those to stop.
Therefore especially in hackerspaces, continuing developments both physical
and online, should be made to better include people outside meetings, hence
'foster'.
