</I>Thanks. The 189m length is quite accurate and makes me think you
unrolled it and measured it?

I've now got quite a lot else on tomorrow so it's not looking likely
that I'll be able to take the time out to do this tomorrow. I don't
think I'm actually needed though if any of the rest of you want to get
it done tomorrow.
Looking like Wednesday next week before I have an appropriate hold in my
schedule to get to this (if no one else get's there ahead of me) and I
wouldn't bet on it not filling up between now and then...

Long periods of drought are always followed by rain.
