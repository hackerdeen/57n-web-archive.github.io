<PRE>Lurker here. FWIW this is a gmail account (actually a GSuite one, formerly
known as Google Apps), and I see things fine. Not sure if it's relevant,
but the address that is subscribed to the list is one that's set to never
be sent to spam.

It is possible that different policies apply to GSuite domains vs gmail.com,
though.
