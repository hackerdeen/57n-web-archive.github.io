<PRE>It looks a lot like email from this list is disappearing when sent to gmail addresses[0]. Does anyone know what we should be looking at to figure out why that is? Would anyone like to learn stuff to try and figure this out? I really don't want to do that so please someone else volunteer :)

Robert

[0] Though there are 25 gmail addresses subscribed to the list and I've only got reports of nothing appearing from 3 of them[1] so would like to hear from anyone else on gmail who is or isn't receiving this. 

[1] One of which is mine. I tried to subscribe with it to test this evening and discovered I was already subscribed but don't seem to be receiving anything via that address.

Long periods of drought are always followed by rain.
