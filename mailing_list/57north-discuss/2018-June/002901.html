</I>&gt;<i> Thanks. The 189m length is quite accurate and makes me think you unrolled it and measured it?

Nah, that's sounds like *way* too much effort. :) You buy professional
network cable and they print on how much is left every meter, so you
don't run out while pulling from a used box/reel.

If anyone is available I can give a hand, but the two requirements are
(or seem to be) that we do it before Engage opens (as we have to pull
through their kitchen ceiling) and we probably need a ladder. Rob and
Steph looked at the route last Tuesday night, so maybe they can advise
on the actual route for the cable?
