We had a bit of a look at this this evening and may now have a plan....

We can plug an ethernet cable into the switch/router in the office at Engage. Still need to confirm what the network looks like on their side but I'm running with the assumption that it'll dish out an IP with DHCP and have NAT to The Internetâ„¢. 

Getting the cable from there down to our space looks doable via ceiling of the office, tile drop ceiling in the kitchen and then through an existing hole in the wall to the stairwell, it can then go down the holes already taking cables down the north east (I think) corner of the stairwell all the way to outside the door at the bottom of the stairs. I didn't look too much at the route further than that as I got distracted and didn't get back to it, but there is only one wall left there to be in the space and I can put a new hole in that wall if needed. 

Most of the effort needed for the cable run will be in getting through the ceilings in Engage. That'll have to be done when they're not too busy (it'll be some disruption to them getting to kitchen/office) so not long after they open (11:00?) on a weekday is probably best. 

I could probably take an hour or so away from work to help run the cable Friday, or some day next week. It would be a lot easier if there was more than just me though :) When would other people be available to help?

Robert

Long periods of drought are always followed by rain.
