<PRE>Hi all,

I would like to discuss the lighting in the space.

I would like to take on the stairway area as i feel it needs improving,
especial when winter rolls round.

I would like to run rgbw strips song the stairs with the white being
activated by a pir device located above both doors (not the fire escape)
with the possibility of being forced on and the rgb being possibly tied
into the main hackspace lighting as per the wiki for the main room.

Could whoever is interested in doing the main room lighting give me a shout
as well so i know who's planning that. If not i could look at doing both
zones if that's any help?

Steph
