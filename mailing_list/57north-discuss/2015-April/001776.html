&gt;<i> Hi Guys,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We'll be visiting Scotland beginning of May and so I was looking for
</I>&gt;<i> places to visit, including Hacker/Makerspaces and so I found you.
</I>
Cool man, I have cc'd this message to our discuss list so others will see it
and chime in.

&gt;<i> I found that you have Themed Thursdays, but I couldn&#8217;t find anything in
</I>&gt;<i> the 1^st half of May and so I wanted to ask if there is anything planned.
</I>
I think the only planned theme Thursday right now is a msp430 night on the 30th
of April.

&gt;<i> In addition I wanted to ask if you maybe have interesting projects done
</I>&gt;<i> or ongoing that you would like to show me and maybe some of them we
</I>&gt;<i> could also rebuild the Hackerspace where I&#8217;m active
</I>&gt;<i> (<A HREF="https://fnordeingang.de/">https://fnordeingang.de/</A>). What would be a good day to visit you? On a
</I>&gt;<i> Tuesday?
</I>
We have an open night every Tuesday from about 1830. That is definately the
best day to come by, it is when there are the most people in the space.

&gt;<i> In addition maybe someone of you could maybe also help me on planning my
</I>&gt;<i> trip.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1^st are there any specific places around in Aberdeen or Scotland that I
</I>&gt;<i> should have seen? Especially Nerdish places I&#8217;m looking for, there I
</I>&gt;<i> found only the Maritime Museum in Aberdeen.
</I>
Nothing particularly comes to mind to me right now, maybe someone else will
have some suggestions. The area around the city is really scenic and well worth
a couple of days of exploring.

&gt;<i> 2^nd Could someone help me on Prepaid Data sim cards?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Due to the fact that the house we have rented has no Internet I wanted
</I>&gt;<i> to purchase a Prepaied Sim card and was thinking that 2GB for 2 weeks
</I>&gt;<i> should be sufficient. So I did a bit of research and looked at
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://prepaid-data-sim-card.wikia.com/wiki/United_Kingdom">http://prepaid-data-sim-card.wikia.com/wiki/United_Kingdom</A>
</I>&gt;<i> Now some questions I have
</I>&gt;<i> Would it be a good option to go for 4GEE Payg Data?
</I>&gt;<i> Giffgaff also looks quite good, but it seems like I can&#8217;t just walk in a
</I>&gt;<i> store and buy a card.
</I>&gt;<i> Or would there be another even better deal for me?
</I>
I think that three have the best data network, you wont be charged any more for
4G. This sim is probably fine for your visit. There is wifi most places, but it
offered via a cloud provider of some sort.

&gt;<i> Thanks in advance and Best Regards from Germany
</I>
Are you planning to go to cccamp this summer?
