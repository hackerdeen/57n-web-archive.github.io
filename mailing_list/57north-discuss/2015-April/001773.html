I meant to reply on Tuesday but got a bit distracted... Tony showing me
round devstack and space bureaucracy ate the whole evening. 

 I've been eyeing up the Zynqs for a while and finally took the plunge
 to get one to play with.  I want to do some playing to get a grip on
 the build and boot process and the interface between the FPGA bit and
 software. 

Longer term I'd like to get this board set up to capture video from
HDMI, encode it to something useful and spit it out over the network.
We've got a nice HDMI camera in the space that we'd like to use to
record talks if we can get a decent capture setup for it. 

I've you've done anything with Zynq before I'd certainly appreciate any
pointers on getting going, and collaboration on the video project might
give me the push needed to actually get something done :)
