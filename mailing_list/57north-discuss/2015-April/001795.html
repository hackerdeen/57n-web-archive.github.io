Hi,  Yan.

Don't get too excited: Check the link to the ITT that Andy posted:

&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/81285110/Documents-APR207238.zip">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/81285110/Documents-APR207238.zip</A>
</I>
Look at this in &quot;Operations_MAKE_Digital_FabWorskshop_ITT.doc&quot; (their
spelling, not mine):

&quot;Tenderers should note that the Council&#8217;s maximum financial contribution
towards the delivery of the tender is &#163;35,000 PA. The contract is valued
at &#163;58,000 based on the equivalent lease value of Council space (&#163;8,000
PA), equipment at a peppercorn rate (&#163;15,000 PA) and the maximum
financial contribution to operations (&#163;35,000). Bids that require a
higher contribution from the council in their financial model in order
to deliver the contract will not be considered and shall be rejected. It
is the expectation that MAKE operates as social enterprise model or
equivalent and the tenderer will contribute to the financial delivery of
this service through income generation. This may include in-kind
contributions, fund raising, sponsorship and income generated through
the delivery of the service such as courses and commissions.&quot;

It's only a one year contract, but with and options to continue for
another one or two more years (if successful).

Not real competition for your 'innovation' hub :-)

Bye,

  Tony.
