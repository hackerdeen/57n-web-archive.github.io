<PRE>
1. Your Name (nick):

Iain Armitage (Spadge)


2. Your Background

Born in Dundee but whisked away to England before I could pick up the accent, always dreamed of settling back in Scotland and when I had the chance took it. Lived in a few places in Angus since coming back but now settled hopefully for a few years to come in Kingswells.

3. Your Hacklab-related Interests

Always been interested by anything technological and always been interested in dismantling things simply to put them back together. I don&#8217;t remember it but when I was 2.5 years old I went to the doctors with my mum and proceeded to dismantle his Otoscope and just as I was about to be told off the doctor told mum to leave me, &#8220;If I could take it apart I could put it back together&quot; and lo-and-behold it was re-assembled again, unfortunately what only came after was a pattern of hell with me taking apart and re-assembling anything I could get my hands on, still survives to this day just bigger and better toys to play with.


4. What knowledge can you bring hacklab community?

4 years in mechanical engineering, 6 years of quality assurance, 2 years of quality control and not that much of it&#8217;ll be any use but knowledge of pressure systems, welding, ultrasonic inspection, painting, CAD from my day jobs and a geek besides. 

5. What do you wish to learn from the hacklab community?

The opportunity to meet and get to know a few like minded individuals, some more knowledge/insight/experience into electronics and arduino/raspberrypi systems and should the opportunity arise the chance to pass on some of my own knowledge in return.


6. Link to photo (not essential but useful)
