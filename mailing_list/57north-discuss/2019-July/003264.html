<PRE>Hiya

I couldn't make it on Tuesday, but it sounds like there were some useful
discussions about this.

We have a wiki page related to this at...
<A HREF="https://wiki.57north.org.uk/index.php/Possible_Future_Space">https://wiki.57north.org.uk/index.php/Possible_Future_Space</A>
...which may be a good place to collate ideas and information about
alternate locations.  There are a few ideas there already, of varying
suitability.  My view of it was that the wiki page could be, at the very
least, a useful place to capture a view of the relevant property landscape.

Cheers

Andy

&gt;<i> Hello Everyone.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Some of you may be aware of the building we are currently in being
</I>&gt;<i> available for all enquiries, this is due to, as far as we know, the
</I>&gt;<i> property having been sold. There is also a rent increase which cannot be
</I>&gt;<i> met by our current membership and membership rate, It appears the landlord
</I>&gt;<i> has an interest in the building being empty, either way, it may not be
</I>&gt;<i> viable to stay.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The gaming cafe concern who we sublet from, soon to be called Reset
</I>&gt;<i> Aberdeen, was also sold and they seem to be interested in moving.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This has been discussed by some of the membership, at the Openday and at
</I>&gt;<i> other times. So what does this mean, and why should you be interested?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It means we are looking for a new location, so we would like to hear from
</I>&gt;<i> anyone who knows of a suitable location which we could use, if the property
</I>&gt;<i> is too big for us we can also approach the gaming cafe, and potentially
</I>&gt;<i> fill a space which we could both share.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This will be a developing situation and we may not have a lot of time to
</I>&gt;<i> arrange this, we have a rolling agreement till the end of September, by
</I>&gt;<i> which time we should ideally have found a suitable location.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any questions you may have, we will endeavour to answer, respond to the
</I>&gt;<i> discuss list, so anyone can see our discussion, or come in on a Tuesday.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We have moved before and we can do it again, so this could be an
</I>&gt;<i> opportunity, to find an even better location for our community.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Mull this over while you enjoy the fine weather we are having.
</I>&gt;<i>
