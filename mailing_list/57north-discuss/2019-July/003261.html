According to our articles every member is liable for £1. See article 8.

As part of forming the company there was a &quot;Statement of Guarantee&quot; filed with companies house that listed the 5 original directors as liable for £1 each.  Nothing has ever been filed to update that (though maybe it didn't need to be as you could argue that as soon as the company was actually formed and had a members registry that was the list of guarantors, but maybe that would be supposed to be published somewhere if that were the case: IANAL).

Doesn't look like I can link directly to the incorporation document, but it is the first one here if anyone wants to have a look:
