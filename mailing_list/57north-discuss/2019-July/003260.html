<PRE>Hi,

Last time I asked, it was £5 with each of the *founding* directors being
equally and severally liable. No one ever updated the list of guarantors
when the list of directors changed.

I haven't actually checked myself and I don't remember who told me this
though, so this could be inaccurate.

Thanks,
Iain.
