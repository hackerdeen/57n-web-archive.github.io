<PRE>Hi folks

Following the creepycam debacle, I thought I'd check with the membership
about a new camera I am wanting to place in the space.

In fabulous Nordin style, I have velco'ed a polyplastic covered Raspberry
pi to the frame of the Space's almost working 3D printer. The Pi itself is
 powered from the printer's board and networked, and so is active when the
printer is. Discreetly moulded on in the Pi case (from a past project) is a
Pi HD Camera mostly looking at the build plate. This cam's ribbon cable has
been detached for the time being.

The plan is to install the browser-based Octoprint [1] printer server for
general use whilst adding a VNC server to the Rasbpian desktop for
Printrun, Repetier and Arduino IDE access. Octoprint has the ability to
monitor and capture time-lapse shots of it's progress via the Pi's cam and
this seems way too cool not to make use of.

If anyone has any objections or suggested conditions to this, do email in.
The suggested 'safe' location of the printer puts it the cam looking
towards outer wall so I would suggest we at least agree not to move it from
here for this reason. I'll also add a plate-facing, constantly on LED light
off the Pi's I/Os to brighten the shots. This will also serve to indicate
that image capturing is taking place.

Cheers,
Nordin
