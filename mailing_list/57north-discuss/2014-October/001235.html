<PRE>I've now got the footage from Krzysztof's (Derecho) talk on Tuesday
about his field trip to test his tape measure yagi cut up and online:
<A HREF="http://idea.bodaegl.com/static/Derecho-Tapemeasure-Yagi-Fieldtrip.webm">http://idea.bodaegl.com/static/Derecho-Tapemeasure-Yagi-Fieldtrip.webm</A>

Where do we want to start collecting these? There was talk of having our
own media server at some point. Or do we just want to go with
youtube/vimeo/other?

I screwed up a few things with the recording so notes for next time:
- Very few people still use 4:3 screens so that's a stupid aspect ratio
to shoot in
- Auto white balance gets messed up when a projector dominates the shot
- don't use it.
- We could really do with more light on the speaker or a camera that
handles low light better than mine (the noise is a bit annoying).
- The audio recording should be somewhere other than sitting on the
table to reduce the background of people typing/knocking the table. I
have a shotgun mic somewhere that I will try and find for next week.  
- If using separate audio the speaker should clap once at start and end
of the talk to make the sync a lot easier (or we could get a clapper
board and look like we're doing things properly).

Anyone spot anything else that is wrong or could be improved?

What are others using for video editing? I used Pitivi for this as it
works (most of the time) with enough features to make this kind of edit
easy and doesn't have a huge learning curve. But it does crash
occasionally (and the autosync doesn't seem to work) so I'd be
interested to hear of alternatives.
