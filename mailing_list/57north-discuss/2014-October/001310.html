Really good ideas !

and really interested in the FPGA talk - can we firm up a date for this
please, this thursday maybe ?


If anyone is interested in knowing how to tweet automatically from a
system please say; I can demo, and give pointers on use and abuse.

&gt;<i> Themed Thursdays have kind of fallen off; I'm keen to see if we can
</I>&gt;<i> resurrect them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've a couple of things that I'd be willing to run:
</I>&gt;<i>  - FPGA programming - there seems to be a couple of people interested in
</I>&gt;<i>  playing with FPGAs. I could run an evening where we go through the
</I>&gt;<i>  fundamental of designing for FPGAs and get flashing lights (and maybe
</I>&gt;<i>  something more adventurous) running on some dev boards (I think I can
</I>&gt;<i>  provide 2 cyclone II boards and a Spartan 6 (I'd have to have a look
</I>&gt;<i>  and see if I can find them - the cyclone II boards are pretty cheap if
</I>&gt;<i>  we need more) to play with.
</I>&gt;<i> - Basic digital electronics - lets grab some resistors and transistors
</I>&gt;<i> and build basic RTL gates and other things. I think the step from single
</I>&gt;<i> transistor to logic is often fuzzy. Resistor transistor logic is pretty
</I>&gt;<i> simple and we could easily wire up a variety of gates on a bread board
</I>&gt;<i> and build something more complicated (I'd go for an adder (not awfully
</I>&gt;<i> complicated but is useful) but am open to suggestions). We could look at
</I>&gt;<i> some of the other options for building logic too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Things I'd be interested in/we've talked about in the past if anyone
</I>&gt;<i> would run them (or be willing to do them with others):
</I>&gt;<i>  - Soldering - Soldering is something that is very easy to do wrong but
</I>&gt;<i>  regularly required. There are lots of tips and tricks that can make it
</I>&gt;<i>  easier. Let's set aside some time to exchange tips/tricks/pointers to
</I>&gt;<i>  where such can be found and make everybodies soldering better (world
</I>&gt;<i>  domination to follow shortly).
</I>&gt;<i> - Pointing robot - We have a robot arm with a laser pointer and some
</I>&gt;<i> plans to use it to find where things are kept in the space. There are
</I>&gt;<i> quite a lot of things that need to be done to get it to do all of that:
</I>&gt;<i> a database/list of what's in the space and where it is (or should be), a
</I>&gt;<i> way to get from that to what we want the arm to do to point at
</I>&gt;<i> something, control/sensing of the arm location, an interface to look up
</I>&gt;<i> something for the arm to point at, power supply for the arm + control
</I>&gt;<i> stuff, probably more stuff that I've forgotten about.  I'd like to work
</I>&gt;<i> on this as a group project.
</I>&gt;<i>  - 3D printer/mill - Ed donated most of the parts needed to make a 3D
</I>&gt;<i>  printer or CNC mill. Could we have an evening to have a look at what
</I>&gt;<i>  the plans are to build it?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is there any interest in any of the above actually happening? Would you
</I>&gt;<i> like something else? Are you willing to run something?
</I>&gt;<i>
