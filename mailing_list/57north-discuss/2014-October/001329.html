Hi, Peet.

[Monty Python voice] You were lucky: We 'ad t' mek our computers out o'
cardboard, bottle-tops and sticky-back plastic...

I'm also a veteran of the Acorn Atom era and I had an early serial no.
BBC Micro because I put myself on a list to get one for teaching when I
worked as a post-doc at (then) Plymouth Polytechnic. We used the Acorn
Atoms to teach a course about using laboratory microcomputers. On one
occasion someone stole the cassette recorder, but left the computer!

&gt;<i> (Aside:  The &quot;Non-rechargable motherboard batteries will explode&quot; is a
</I>&gt;<i> myth, inasmuch as all the rechargable ones have pins or wires
</I>&gt;<i> permanently attached to the battery to solder into the motherboard,
</I>&gt;<i> while the non-rechargables all clip into a &quot;holder&quot; so it's impossible
</I>&gt;<i> to fit a non-rechargable into a board that trickle-charges unless you're
</I>&gt;<i> dumb enough to solder pins/wires onto the battery yourself...)
</I>
The ML2032 is a rechargeable version of the CR2032 and, in my extreme
ignorance, I thought that some of the server motherboards I'd salvaged
in the past had used this type of battery and trickle charged it. I was
just being cautious about it until I knew that the motherboards I have
now do NOT trickle charge their batteries. However, they do stop them
from discharging as long as the motherboard is powered up. The reason
all mine had gone flat was not that they were out of date, but they had
been powered off for over two years with their batteries in the socket.

Bye,

  Tony.
