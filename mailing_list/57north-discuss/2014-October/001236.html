</I>
I would aim for a CC license(I like 0) and putting the video on the internet
archive. We could easily have a page on our website (not the fucking wiki)
where the Tuesday videos and maybe other videos are collected together.

&gt;<i> I screwed up a few things with the recording so notes for next time:
</I>&gt;<i> - Very few people still use 4:3 screens so that's a stupid aspect ratio
</I>&gt;<i> to shoot in
</I>&gt;<i> - Auto white balance gets messed up when a projector dominates the shot
</I>&gt;<i> - don't use it.
</I>&gt;<i> - We could really do with more light on the speaker or a camera that
</I>&gt;<i> handles low light better than mine (the noise is a bit annoying).
</I>&gt;<i> - The audio recording should be somewhere other than sitting on the
</I>&gt;<i> table to reduce the background of people typing/knocking the table. I
</I>&gt;<i> have a shotgun mic somewhere that I will try and find for next week.  
</I>&gt;<i> - If using separate audio the speaker should clap once at start and end
</I>&gt;<i> of the talk to make the sync a lot easier (or we could get a clapper
</I>&gt;<i> board and look like we're doing things properly).
</I>
I haven't watched the video, but I think a shotgun mic for the presentation
sounds good. Having another mic for questions might also be an idea.

&gt;<i> Anyone spot anything else that is wrong or could be improved?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What are others using for video editing? I used Pitivi for this as it
</I>&gt;<i> works (most of the time) with enough features to make this kind of edit
</I>&gt;<i> easy and doesn't have a huge learning curve. But it does crash
</I>&gt;<i> occasionally (and the autosync doesn't seem to work) so I'd be
</I>&gt;<i> interested to hear of alternatives. 
</I>
I have been using iMovie at work, it is not good. If you find something better
than will run on linux AND OS X that would be awesome.
