<PRE>Hiya



1. Your Name (nick):
Andy Gaskell (Andy)


2. Your Background

I'm a  LAMP web dev, mainly using Joomla and other Open Source packages.  I
went solo doing web development in 2009, just after moving to Aberdeen.
Before that I lived in Glasgow and worked in Cumbernauld for a company
called Nallatech who do FPGA accelerator hardware.  Before the I spent a
year in Sydney working at Canon Research on Camera software.  The, before
that I lived in Edinburgh and worked in Dunfermline doing IT and web
development.  Before that... in case you're still reading... I was at
Napier Uni (1998-2001) doing industrial design.  I grew up in South London
before heading to Uni.  The missus works in the hospital (diabetes) and 2
small monkeys who are in p1 &amp; p2.  My first computer was a Commodore
Plus/4, about 25ish years ago.


3. Your Hacklab-related Interests

I'm a web developer, so I'm more code than hardware.  I used to write Linux
drivers for FPGA accelerator cards, but my C is pretty rusty now.  I'd like
to more art-hacks, funny conceptual stuff, maybe with random numbers.  As I
work at home, self employed, out-of-hours hacking often ends up being work
related, so getting to the space will maybe separate work hacking and more
fun hacking, which will be good.


4. What knowledge can you bring hacklab community?

Plenty of web development stuff.  A fair bit on Linux and VM system and a
little bit of RTOS background.  I'm quite good at burning myself with a
soldering iron, but isn't anyone.  Quite handy with 3D design, making and
that sort of stuff, due to enthusiasm for DIY and a degree in Industrial
Design.  My languages or choice are mainly PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScipt, SQL,
C / C++, Perl, Bash, Tcl/Tk, Python, VB and Matlab.  Also I have extensive
working knowledge of kids TV and toys, so... I could teach folk how to make
3 different types of loom band... if anyone wanted :(


5. What do you wish to learn from the hacklab community?

We're always all learning all the time, from the world around us.  I think
kind of learning by doing, in a setting where other people are doing stuff
too, will be good.  More practically, the other day I realised I need to
know more about transformers and PSUs.

7.
Yes
