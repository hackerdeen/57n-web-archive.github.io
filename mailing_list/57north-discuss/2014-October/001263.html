<PRE>Hi Peet.

I have added you to the subscription list for discuss. All your emails will
now go straight through. Not sure how your others have been missed.

On 10 October 2014 13:18, &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.57north.co/listinfo/57north-discuss">peet at myflat.org.uk</A>&gt; wrote:

If it's easy to find - go for it. Dummy cameras are useful - we can use
these as cases and stuff our own awesome DIY tech inside.

And...  Any news of a move to ground floor premises?  When I joined up I

was told that was likely to be in place by the end of September...?

We have just voted new directors and have yet to hold a board meeting, so
cannot speak for the new board. That said, I believe we are still looking
at our best options. In terms of getting more accessible floor space - it's
still an aim but we have to be careful about sustainability going forward.
Presently we have less members than needed to break even (although happily
this is improving), but are in the black due to additional member donations
and fund-raising. It's been suggested one direction might be to see if any
locations can offer us better space for a low rate on the basis that we
meet a shared goal with the owner (i.e. community engagement, third-party
access etc). No harm in members collecting leads here.

It certainly will be raised as an agenda item for said directors meeting. I
plan on sending out a draft agenda and finding a suitable time as my next
todo item.

Cheers,
Ed
