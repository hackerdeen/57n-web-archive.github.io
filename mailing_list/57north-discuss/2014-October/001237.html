I&#8217;d suggest YouTube. It is, by far, the most popular site for video. It&#8217;s also free, they have a player that works well across platforms, and they have the infrastructure to handle different bandwidths. Plus, YouTube is unlikely to disappear any time soon.

Of course, we could also provide a direct download somewhere in WebM.

&gt;<i> I screwed up a few things with the recording so notes for next time:
</I>&gt;<i> - Very few people still use 4:3 screens so that's a stupid aspect ratio

</I>
4:3 works better for the slides, though. I&#8217;m not sure it matters too much.

&gt;<i> What are others using for video editing? I used Pitivi for this as it
</I>&gt;<i> works (most of the time) with enough features to make this kind of edit

</I>&gt;<i> interested to hear of alternatives. 
</I>
When I was on Ubuntu I used OpenShot, it&#8217;s alright. To be honest, though, video editing completely sucks on OSes that aren&#8217;t Windows or OS X. If you want a decent free video editor, try the former Windows Live Movie Maker (now called Movie Maker and part of Windows Essentials, IIRC). But that requires a Windows install.
