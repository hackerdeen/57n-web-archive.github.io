Hi, Tom.

Thanks for your support :-)

They are pedestal (tower) servers in (quiet) Fractal Design Define XL R2 
cases, not rack-mounted servers  and they are quiet enough to be run in 
an office environment taking into account what Rob said about the 2kW 
heat load (i.e. most of the power consumed ends up as heat). It might be 
worth mentioning to Isobel that in the winter this might actually reduce 
the heating bill.

I'm coming into the University on Thu 29 Jul, to bring back one of our 
servers that I upgraded at home because of Covid-19 restrictions, if you 
want to meet up for a coffee?

Bye,

   Tony.
