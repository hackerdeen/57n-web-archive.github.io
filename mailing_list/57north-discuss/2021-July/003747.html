<PRE>Hi

I'll be along for the first time in a couple of weeks, having been
away to exciting locations like London and Aviemore, on the last
couple of tuesdays.

Will probably be tinkering with a plant watering thing using a Pi
Pico, mumbling about how Python isn't PHP and soldering small things
very badly.

Cheers

Andy

</I>&gt;<i> Hi All,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's open Tuesday at 57North Hacklab! Aberdeen City remains at
</I>&gt;<i> protection level 1, which means we can invite people to our open
</I>&gt;<i> Tuesday events.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We will start around 7pm and remain at our location in Unit H, Kettock
</I>&gt;<i> Lodge, Campus Two, Innovation Park, AB22 8GU.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'll be down fitting my 20A DC-to-DC leisure battery charger to a
</I>&gt;<i> mounting panel, fitting said plate into the rear of my van; then
</I>&gt;<i> hopefully testing the in-car charging setup.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> See you there. Given I'll be popping out to the van a lot, I will
</I>&gt;<i> likely not be online via WorkAdventure[1]. Hopefully others will tho.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Nordin.

</I>&gt;<i> We are participating in the Scottish Government's contact tracing
</I>&gt;<i> programme. You will find purple posters at the entrance to the space and
</I>&gt;<i> around the space that contain QR codes. Please scan the QR code and
</I>&gt;<i> provide your contact details. If you are unable to scan a QR code, there
</I>&gt;<i> is a link to type into your browser. If you cannot use the link, ask
</I>&gt;<i> someone else to check in for you and provide them with your email
</I>&gt;<i> address and phone number.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please note that contact tracing is a requirement of participating in an
</I>&gt;<i> Open Tuesday in person, and is not negotiable. If you do not provide
</I>&gt;<i> tracing details you will be asked to leave.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As we emerge from this global disaster, some will understandably be
</I>&gt;<i> cautious about being outside. Please respect people's boundaries by
</I>&gt;<i> maintaining social distancing and wearing a mask as you move around the
</I>&gt;<i> space. If you are sat down, you can take off your mask to have easier
</I>&gt;<i> access to your face if needed for eating or drinking. Use common sense
</I>&gt;<i> and remember this is a shared space.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you are in early, open windows to get air flowing through the
</I>&gt;<i> space. It could be a good idea to bring a jumper or something as the
</I>&gt;<i> space could be a little cooler than you might expect because of this.
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/important COVID related info&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 57North Hacklab Ltd. is a company registered in Scotland (No. SC470230).
</I>&gt;<i> 57North and 57North Hacklab are trading names of 57North Hacklab Ltd.
