I'd be opposed to 57North paying for the electricity for this. It'll be in the ball park of all our income⁰. As much as I'd like to play with a compute cluster I don't think it's worth (possibly more than) all of the space's money.

⁰ Accounts for last year¹ give us ~£3k income and ~£2k surplus, membership graph definitely looks like we'd be down from that now.²
