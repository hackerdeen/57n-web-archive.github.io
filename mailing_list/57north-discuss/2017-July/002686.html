I won't be in, rain was forecast earlier when I made this decision. 

I will be at the IET thing this weekend, those with children might want
to attend:

We probably need two more people to help run the nerf gun range and the
brush bot thing. It **will** be fun, I promise. 

If you want to come and help just email me directly.
