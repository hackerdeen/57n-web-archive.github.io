I'll be along. I think I'll be playing with code to simulate fire,
possibly solder up a better set of lights for it.

There is a meeting to discuss the future of ORG Aberdeen on Thursday
that might be of interest to folks here:

This week the Unix timestamp ticks past 1.5e9 @ 03:40 local time
(02:40 UTC) on Friday.

I've had a terminal displaying the timestamp for a while to watch it
approach. The command there has gotten a bit ridiculous - I only
discovered last week that figlet has fonts :)

while true; do figlet -f poison.flf -w 150 `date +%s`| lolcat; sleep 1; done

The next nine appears just before midnight tomorrow.

I'm planning to watch the rest of them appear in the buildup to the
big event. Anyone else feel like marking this meaningless milestone in
the space?
