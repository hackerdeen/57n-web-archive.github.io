I would like to country the stupid shit hackathon idea with a 'Shit
hackerdeen bot says' hackathon.

&gt;<i> That should do August/September/October. Who's on November and

</I>
Oh man I am totally on board for fireworks.

These people <A HREF="https://store.fireworxscotland.co.uk/">https://store.fireworxscotland.co.uk/</A>
are located close to one of our servers and offer great prices for high
quality fireworks(none of that super market shit). 

We would need to find somewhere to have a party with space for them.
