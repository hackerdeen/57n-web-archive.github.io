<PRE>Morning All,

More than half the year has gone! Oh goodness, where did it all go?

It's been a bit of a quiet one at 57N this year! I've been quite bad for
going to other places and playing with toys there. 

Let's sort that and get some weekend events on the go! I'd really like
to see one weekend event a month happening in the hackerspace.  It can
be a one day, two day or 3 day event! They don't take much work to
organise, and we're all willing to pitch in to make it happen!

There is a new category on the wiki -  Events [1] - which can be used to
list your event. Just add `[[Category:Events]]`  to the bottom of your
wiki page and it'll appear! There is probably a fancy way that semantic
mediawiki can make this easier, we'll work that out as we go along. 

Before the end of the year, I intend to run a Game Jam [2], another OSM
Mapping weekend[2] and the popular Stupid Shit No One Needs hackathon
[3]. That should do August/September/October. Who's on November and
December? ChristmasHax could be fun, and I'd love to do a Fireworks
session in November for Guy Fawkes // TJ's Birthday weekend, but that
seems like a Bad Idea(tm).

Thoughts, ideas, questions and comments are all encouraged and welcome!
