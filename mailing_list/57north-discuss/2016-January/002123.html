Yeah, I'd like to head down too.

Definitely needs soldering. Something like 10 joins per screen so not a
huge job (as long as I start earlier than 3am on the day). Could also do
with some work to get the external memory working so that it can display
more than the 4 &quot;pixels&quot; per screen I had it doing last time I wired it
up. Plus some software work to actually send it pictures... I'm sure
three months is plenty of time to sort that out though :)

Unless anyone else really wants to build a frame again I think we'd be
better off just putting screens on the floor/tables (maybe take a box or
two to get a second height on the table). Though I think most of the
screens have still got the wood attached to the back which was the
finicky bit.
