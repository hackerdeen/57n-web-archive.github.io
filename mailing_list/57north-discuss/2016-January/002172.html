Try to sync recordings done on two machines and you will know how it

Bowie didn't have to deal with this shit.

The Taylor Swift themed Scottish security conference hasn't sold out
yet[1]. You should go, you want to speak to other Scots with similar
interests. Tickets are super cheap.

The continued creativity of this place is fucking great.
