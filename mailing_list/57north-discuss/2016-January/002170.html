<PRE>Spiffing idea, Ted:

<A HREF="https://pad.57north.org.uk/p/edinburgh_maker_faire_2016">https://pad.57north.org.uk/p/edinburgh_maker_faire_2016</A>

If you're planning on coming, please add Name/Project/etc to the pad.
Please don't sign up to exhibit if you're not planning on bringing a 
project or have something related you can use to engage with members of 
the public on - we're going to be space limited and I'd like to use that 
space wisely.
---HOWEVER---
You're more than welcome to come and see/experience the Maker Faire and 
wider Edinburgh International Science Festival. The EISF[1] is a 
fantastic event that deserves your support. Judging on my previous 
experiences[2], Make(tm) events attract a wide range of interesting and 
creative people who you might want to meet, engage with and get excited 
by, and I'd recommend coming just for that.
If you want to come along in that capacity, just stick 'attending' down 
as your project.

Note: Our application has not yet been accepted, this may all be for 
nothing!

--------------------------
I'm trying out this format for event organisation - constructive 
feedback is welcome.
