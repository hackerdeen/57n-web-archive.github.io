That sounds like a good plan, and is along the lines I was thinking (I
was going to try asking rather than demanding...).

I was more thinking of getting it down to Edinburgh and how much space
we'll have to set it up in. 

We've definitely cut up some of the bits that were the frame last time.
Is there still a pack of wood in your lab? If so that would do for the
legs, would need to see how much 15x35mm ish wood we've got left for the
other bits and see if the hinges are still about. Even if we need to get
all the bits again it wasn't that expensive.
