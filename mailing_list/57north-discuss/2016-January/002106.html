You can probably fit 15 people in the space (though that might be
more people than we have seats) if they don't mind being a little
squashed. We do have a projector and can usually clear enough of a
wall to point it at.

Alternatively, if you can find a room somewhere else but need a
projector feel free to borrow it.
