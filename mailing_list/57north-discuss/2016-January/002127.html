I think that can be worked out if we decided to go and someone submits
the paper work. I can get a van from the coop or a member might have a
vehicle that can move the large wooden sections.

The most important thing is that someone does the paper work.

Yeah there is still wood here.

We have plenty of time to do this as long as we start now, rather than
the week of.
