Okay, do you want to apply for a table/space/whatever it is they offer?
Does someone want to organise this? I probably don't have time.

What do we take? 

	* tv wall (needs work, but it might just need soldering)
	* badge kits (maybe stuff for making them too)
	* flyers about the space (we should make some anyway)
	* space stickers (we need more)
	* bbs
	* as many leds as we can power	

Is that list plus the stuff I haven't thought of enough to make us look
good?
