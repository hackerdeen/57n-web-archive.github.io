<PRE>I decided I'd like to be able to see some of our benches again so have
been doing some tidying up in the space this evening. While I was at it
I went through some of the piles of junk and have now got a long list of
things that I think are surplus to requirements. If something on this
list is yours, expensive or useful please speak up, otherwise I'm
planning to get rid of it at some point in the not too distant future -
though I will wait at least a week to give folk a chance to notice this
and speak up for anything that shouldn't be binned.

Assuming not everything on this list gets a reprieve:  would someone
with a vehicle be available some evening next week to transport stuff
&quot;away&quot;?

The list:

A box with some cables, rope, sunscreen.... I think this came back from
camp?

A box of batteries labeled &quot;dead batteries&quot;. I assume these are dead
batteries waiting to be chucked.

A pile of rackmount servers. They've been in a pile in the corner for a
while. They should really get gone.

this point.

A monitor that's had some hacking: face is gone, cut cables to where the
face was, no PSU with it (needs 12v 3A). I wouln't bet on it working so
don't think it's worth keeping.

STK500 - I took this in when we first started as it had been sitting in
my flat unused for years. It has now sat unused in the space for a
couple of years (I think Tom tried to use it and it didn't work, I don't
know if the problem was with Tom, the STK500 or something else; or if it
is fixable). Does anyone want it?

Disco lights. Has DNH naming Iain. If I'm remembering previous
discussions correctly these are missing a bulb. They've been here for a
couple of years now: is anything ever going to be done with them?
<A HREF="https://www.flickr.com/photos/35386952@N02/23984762514/in/datetaken/">https://www.flickr.com/photos/35386952@N02/23984762514/in/datetaken/</A>

CD folder. I thought this was in the &quot;to be chucked&quot; pile last time we
tried this, but it still seems to be here and now has developed some
disks.

Chocolate box with servos and some power components. Is this part of the
space parts selection? Someone's personal stash?

Xilinx box with Virtex 5 dev board and some headers and cables and other
related goodies.

And that's where I gave up. There is still more untidy piles of
junk/really useful stuff about the space if anyone else wants to go
through them...

Finally the vortex has expanded from 3 to 4 boxes, all of them are full,
and it's been like that for a while. I propose to get rid of the lot.
