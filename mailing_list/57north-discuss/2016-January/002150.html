Subject: [57north-announce] Hackday Tuesday

Good Tuesday Hackers!

You know the drill for tonight - It's open Tuesday. Bring your self and
optionally bring a friend or colleague*.

If you're coming in, reply with a suggestion of what you will be doing.

I'll start:

Tonight, Matthew, I'm going to be setting up a server to run virtual
machines on and setting up a vulnerable VM on it for people to prod at
with the metasploit framework.

Lots of love and kisses,

Hibby

* If you don't have a friend or colleague, ask your doctor to recommend
one to you [1]
