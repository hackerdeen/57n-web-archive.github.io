<PRE>Hi All,

I should be getting some paperwork shortly from RSGB to indicate that I
have become a registered assessor.

Many hackerspace people have had difficulties in doing the training and
practical assessments at the radio club due to the timing, and so I'm
going to offer to do practical assessments for foundation and
intermediate levels at the hackerspace.

I will first start with the intermediate practicals, because they are
easy to get set up for and there should be a bunch of people that can
all get started on this.

If you have a foundation license, you can get your intermediate
practical assessments done and then sit both the intermediate and
advanced exams in the same day.

If you are interested in doing either the foundation or intermediate
level practicals and exam, please let me know so I can see how much
interest there is. I expect to start with a first group in January.

There is a new syllabus since September 2019, so if you have the old
books watch out for the changes.

Thanks,
Iain.
</PRE>
