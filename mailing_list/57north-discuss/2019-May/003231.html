&gt;<i> Hi all, sorry for the late announcement.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The Space will be open from 7pm at the space on Skene Terrace[1].
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you've not heard of us, we get up to a range of activities on
</I>&gt;<i> Tuesday nights, including but not limited to social contact,
</I>&gt;<i> programming, manufacturing weird things and consuming sugary treats.
</I>&gt;<i> We usually begin at about 7, but sometimes someone will be in earlier.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We're located downstairs from Engage Gaming. Access is through our
</I>&gt;<i> door just beside the Assembly on Skene Terrace! If you're unsure about
</I>&gt;<i> anything, ask in IRC[1]. If you're new, I'd suggest you bring a
</I>&gt;<i> laptop, and perhaps a project you want to work on. If you're coming
</I>&gt;<i> in, feel free to reply and tell us all what you're planning to do!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'll be in from 8 as I have to pack for my next work trip's early
</I>&gt;<i> start tomorrow. Has anyone thought of inventing a combo VR headset +
</I>&gt;<i> travel pillow? I feel I would use a combo VR headset + travel pillow.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I will be in once I have eaten and the parking is sensible. I'll be
talking about camping.
