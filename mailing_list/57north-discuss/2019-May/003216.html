I will be in, I have a ONE THING THAT MUST BE DONE today, and if it
isn't done by the time I head to space I'll be doing that.

If it is done I'll be faffing with a typewriter or some leds or
something like that.

If you are coming camping now is the time to work on cool projects
(lights are always good) for them to have a chance of being almost done
by the time we hit the field.
