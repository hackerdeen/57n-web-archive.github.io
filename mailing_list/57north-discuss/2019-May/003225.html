<PRE>When tidying up this evening I came across an old Sharp Zaurus (SL-5500). While hunting for a barrel plug that would fit it to see if it would still do anything I was wondering what it could actually be used for. It not having any network connections other than IRDA made me conclude: not a lot. 

I got to thinking about ripping out it's guts and putting some more modern electronics in there. I'm pretty sure a pi zero would fit in the case (there is a lot of empty space at the top for the CF card slot). Some pictures of it with a banana pi zero for scale:

I don't think I have the time to actually do this, so rather than me putting the zaurus back into the cupboard here for the day when I magically develop a load of free time and actually get that far through my project list: would anyone else like to have a go at it? Or even just open it up and have a look at the interfaces to screen and keyboard to see if they are something that could feasibly be connected to a pi?

Or does anyone have a use for an unmodified zaurus that may or may not still work (I never did find a barrel plug that fit)?

I do know everything, just not all at once. It's a virtual memory problem.
