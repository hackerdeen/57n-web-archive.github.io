Hi, Doc.

I'm in, er..., Europe just now installing all those servers that I built
for my friend Luca in Milan :-)

I got bitten to death by mosquitoes when I visited the 'bosco' at the
weekend for my friends birthday/wedding anniversary celebration: We had
a great time there in a wonderful location, but so did the mosquitoes!

Back in the Space on Tue 26 Jul.

Bye,

  Tony.
