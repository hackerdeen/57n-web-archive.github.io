I will in the space tonight, Hibby wants my super awesome radio beacons to
send people on a wild goose chase at emfcamp. I will be trying to
remember where the code is for those.

&gt;<i> Tomorrow is techmeetup, which this month is Tom talking about how the
</I>&gt;<i> internet is broken:
</I>
Yes, I will be speaking. It will be really good, and, if you get it over
with now you won't have to ask me about my job for two years. Imagine
that, you won't have to listen to me speak for TWO YEARS!!!
