Hello,


I am interested in joining 57North, so I have filled out the info:


???????1. Name (username):? Stuart Waddell (stuartpaterson480)

2. Your Background: Magnolia painted wall (see photo).  Also perhaps relevant: moved to Abdn in 2002 working for Police lab as chemist then in 2008 moved to RGU as lecturer.  I'm doing a PhD part-time and could be doing with some hackspertise in something I am planning.  Should mention I work in the same office as Ed.

3. Your Hacklab-related Interests: Using Arduino &amp; Raspberry Pi - I am not the most proficient in the world but I have put together a shield for a robot arm using an Arduino Mega (dying to show somebody).

4. What knowledge can you bring hacklab community: Novel and interesting ways to break Raspberry Pi's (assuming 5 V = 3.3 V is a good start).

5. What do you wish to learn from the hacklab community: I have all the basic info I need for the two projects I want to build/run as I found them on github.  However I need help with some of the electronic components and some of the coding (Java, C and python).

6. Link to photo (not essential but useful): <A HREF="http://www.rgu.ac.uk/dmstaff/waddell-stuart">http://www.rgu.ac.uk/dmstaff/waddell-stuart</A>

?Thank-you,

Stuart
