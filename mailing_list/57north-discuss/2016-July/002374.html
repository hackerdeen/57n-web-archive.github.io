Hi, Rob.

I'm on my way back from Milan by car just now after installing the
RozoFS storage cluster that I've been building recently.

I was in Andermatt (Switzerland) last night, which was wonderful but it
tested my Freelander2 a bit by going up very steep roads with 300Kg of
Italian soil in the back... In Colmar (France) just now and it's too
hot! I hear it's been hot in Aberdeen too?

Back at the Hackspace on Tue 26th to twiddle my thumbs while you all do
interesting stuff :-)

Bye,

  Tony.
