I will be in.

I will be using the space desktop to try and use openscad, that
probably means wrestling with Ed for access. 

I will also be asking Ed about further plot holes in Leviathan Wakes that
came to me in a dream.

It appears that we have finally started a technical book club, if anyone
is interested bug me tonight and I will get around to posting on the
bbs.
