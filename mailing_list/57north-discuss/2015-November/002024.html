<PRE>For the logging of data I was originally thinking of running a loop and constantly sending messages. Then measuring the current consumption with the multimeter and getting some average over 20 sec. The other option - with the current sensor would be to do a measurement every 50ms for 20 sec and send every measurement from the sensor over the serial to my laptop. I might be approaching this from the wrong side... I like the idea of using a button to build and send messages. I don't consider myself expert in electronics, but here is how I was envisioning this in my head (see attached ProjectDiagram.png). Arduino 3 would be used purely to utilize the current sensor. It would measure the current consumption of Arduino 1 then the current consumption on Arduino 2; hence the dashed lines.


Example setup and run (purely theoretical) for measuring current consumption on Arduino 2:


Arduino 3:

    SETUP

    set pin 11 as Output (Arduino 2 pin 12)

    set pin 12 as Input (Arduino 2 pin 11)

    LOOP

    if some event (button press or input from Serial) occurs

        set pin 11 to HIGH (to start Arduino 2)

        start measuring current on Arduino 2


    if pin 12 is HIGH

        stop measuring current on Arduino 2

        set pin 11 to LOW


Arduino 2:

    SETUP
    set pin 11 as Output (Arduino 3 pin 12)
    set pin 12 as Input (Arduino 3 pin 11)
    LOOP
    if pin 12 is HIGH
        read sensor data
        construct message (character string or object depending on the method being tested)
        send message
        set pin 11 to HIGH
        delay(?) not sure for synchronisation???
    else
        set pin 11 to LOW

Throwing this aside I must admit I'm not familiar with the functionality of Red Pitaya, but from what you've written it might work in place of Arduino 3 in my design.

Regards,
Ventsislav

I was originally hoping to measure the current consumption with a multimeter, but the current consumption might fluctuate too quick for me to register meaningful data. What I believe will work is to measure how much power will be consumed with a current sensor (ACS712) and log the data. However as I don't have such sensor and the estimated delivery for one is way past my deadline I was hoping that you guys have 1 I could borrow.

In all cases any feedback would be greatly appreciated [??]

I think the current sensor chips are overkill for what you're doing here (and the power changes you'll be looking at will be a few orders of magnitude from what they're designed for so might be lost in the noise): the devices you're looking at are powered by low voltage DC; just put a known small resistor in the power line and measure the voltage across it.

The (slightly more) complicated part will be logging the data. What kind of time frame are you talking about for the building and sending the message/object? I expect it's much shorter than you have any change of getting with a multimeter, pencil and paper. I have a Red Pitaya[1] in the space that I think would work for this. It could be set up to grab voltage readings at whatever period is needed (well, probably: max sample rate is 125MS/s) based on trigger on the other channel, then put one channel over the resistor and the other to a button that's also connected to the pi/arduino to trigger message building and sending. Can have the data output to python or matlab (or some other places) for further processing.
