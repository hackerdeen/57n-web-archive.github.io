Computational Social Science; a new social physics

Admission free, no booking required.
Wood Foundation Centre for Science and Technology, Robert Gordon's
College, Schoolhill.

A look at how the data from digital technology we use everyday can be used.
As digital technologies, the internet and social media become
increasingly integrated into society, our daily lives generate
unprecedented quantities of digital data. These data provide
opportunities to study complex social systems in frameworks similar to
those of the natural sciences. We will discuss these new opportunities
and the latest advancements in Computational Social Science.
Also part of the University of Aberdeen&#8217;s Festival of Social Science and
Science in the Quad Season 3.

winning comedy writer and performer whose first Edinburgh Fringe solo
show, It Is Rocket Science! was later developed into a BBC Radio 4
series   &#822;   along with some of the brightest and most creative
researchers from across Scotland to explore these questions, and to
consider what it means to be human in the twenty-first century.
