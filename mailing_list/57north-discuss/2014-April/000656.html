So whose thinking of going to this ?



o/

I'm going.



I could get a train there, but it would be easier with a lift. The tent
is pretty big to carry, and i'll likely need an airbed and double
duvet.. (so small MGs wouldn't work)


The closest you can get by train is still about 10 miles away. I'm sure
we can sort out lifts from Aberdeen for anybody who wants one.

This is also something I would like to see on facebook so I can share
it more easily.. Would it be ok for me to add it to the 57 North page
when the tickets are launched tomorrow ?


I'd say it would be fine to create a facebook event under the 57 stuff.
CampGND is kind of a 57N project but we held off billing  it as such as
it was only a subset of 57N people involved so we didn't want to claim
the group imprimatur without discussion.
