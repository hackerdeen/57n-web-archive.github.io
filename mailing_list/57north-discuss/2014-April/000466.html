<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>A few of us did some tidying up in the space tonight. Thanks to those
who were helping voluntarily and also sorry to those who were closer to
the press-ganged end of the spectrum. 

We have cleared all the benches and organised things a bit, some of the
stuff that was generating clutter has been reunited with the people who
brought them in and they have been taken away. 

Stuff that now has a home in the space is listed here:
<A HREF="https://57north.co/wiki/WhereStuffLives">https://57north.co/wiki/WhereStuffLives</A>
We need to do more with organising where things should be. 

I'd like to keep things tidy so to that end I would like to see a clear
bench policy with everybody clearing benches when they are done.
Hopefully that'll let us keep on top of the clutter and keep the space
ready to be used. 

My self appointed dictatorial powers unfortunately don't come with
omniscience so I need everyone at the space to help make sure that this
happens. If you come into the space and there is stuff left out could
you please drop a note to the list to note that fact and give a reminder
to everyone to clear up when they're done. I don't want such reminders
to devolve into trying to lay blame for the mess so the only replies I
would want to see to them would be from someone holding their hands up
to say it was them and that they will endeavour to do better. 

If the space doesn't stay tidy then I will be displeased. Glowering and
tutting will probably then ensue.

Robert

Instructions should be read first, or not at all.
Anything else is admitting defeat...
