the current card reader no longer works, so it needs replacing. RFID would be a better solution as its contact less, difficult to wipe with magnets, and more and more things are starting to use it. The system that Tony is bringing up is going to be in our hands, which is better than the nothing we have now.

All we will need is a different type of card to print on. Being contact less they are a lot less likely to wear out, and easier to use as you just hold them against it. There's even wallets out there to protect the paranoid amongst us from having the RFID data stolen.
