<PRE>Hi guys,

I've run a few calculations to try and work out how many servers the space can use.

The calculations assume that there is a dedicated pair of 13A main sockets for the server rack, and that they will conform to specifications and carry the current without any problem. 

The 1950 model has the follow specs:
Power supply: 670W
Weight: 16.3kg 
Height: 1u

The 2950:
Power Supply: 750W
Weight: 26.76kg
Height: 2u

Based on these values, I would not recommend using more than 8x 1950 servers over the 2 sockets (ie 4 per pdu, with each pdu plugged into a socket). This combination will draw 5.36 kW, and even at this there may be little overhead for any problems with cables or heating. 

8x 1950 servers will weigh 130Kg (I believe without rails) which is on top of the weight of the rack. It is up to the committee to decide if it is suitable for this much weight to placed on top of the current weight in that area. 

8x1950 will put out around as much heat as 3x 2kW heaters, so consideration may have to be given to providing some form of cooling for the room, especially in the summer months. 

The above set up would give 64 cores assuming quad core CPUs in both sockets of each server. 

Using the larger 2950 in 12u would result in 6 servers, which is 160.56kg, 4.5kW and 48 cores. 

These figures use maximum levels for values, actual consumption may be less, but if the server is running near 100% then these will not be far off. I would not recommend running with the combined power supply values being greater than the 2990kW provided by a 13A plug. Some overhead for cable heating, allowance for old cabling, etc should be left as well.

I may be around tomorrow, in which case I will try to sort something out with getting these into the space, but there is no guarantee.

Regards
Calum
