<PRE>Thanks for putting this together Ed.

&gt;<i> They are also asked to pay 1 months member fee at their first space visit.
</I>
I think charging &#163;20 to drop in on a Tuesday night could put quite a few
potential members off. I would prefer to ask them for a &#163;5 &quot;suggested
donation&quot;, the same as we ask from 'casual users' of the space. After all,
what's the distinction between the two at that point?

I also think it would be worth encouraging them to fill out and submit an
application while they're actually in the space, or at least leave some
contact details. This would give them something to do on their first night
and would hopefully reduce the likelihood that they'll disappear and never
be heard from again.

Cheers,
Calum

&gt;<i> Hi all
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Below is a proposed new member procedure. Comments/objections welcome.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [The procedure]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. New members are asked to populate an email template (see below) and
</I>&gt;<i> send it to the public discussion list. They are also asked to pay 1 months
</I>&gt;<i> member fee at their first space visit. A director must be present to accept
</I>&gt;<i> this, with a receipt given.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Members are encouraged to email commentary to board members regarding
</I>&gt;<i> the new member.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Board members are tasked to observe any objections over a 5 day
</I>&gt;<i> consultation period. The initial member fee and any application objections
</I>&gt;<i> are registered with a tasked board member. The tasked board member is
</I>&gt;<i> either tasked overall, rota'ed or selected ad-hoc at the point the
</I>&gt;<i> application is received. If no objections are recorded from the board,
</I>&gt;<i> membership is deemed approved.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4. The member is notified of the outcome within 7 days of the application
</I>&gt;<i> date via email by the tasked board member. If accepted, info collection,
</I>&gt;<i> hackhub account creation and space induction is carried out by a tasked
</I>&gt;<i> space member. If not accepted, fees paid are returned in full by the tasked
</I>&gt;<i> director.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [The email]
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thank you for showing interest in joining the 57north Hacklab.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any person who wishes to become a member of the hacklab must submit an
</I>&gt;<i> application for membership, along with a remittance to meet the first
</I>&gt;<i> month's subscription (&#163;20). The application will then be considered by the
</I>&gt;<i> board of directors.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We ask prospective members to make their application via an introduction
</I>&gt;<i> email to the public discussion list. Your membership will then be
</I>&gt;<i> considered by the board with member input. You will be notified 1 week or
</I>&gt;<i> less from the submission date whether your application was successful. Your
</I>&gt;<i> subscription fee will be refunded in the event of your membership not being
</I>&gt;<i> accepted.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please fill in your own responses to the following items, and email them
</I>&gt;<i> to <A HREF="http://lists.57north.co/listinfo/57north-discuss">57north-discuss at lists.57north.co</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Your Name (nick): *
</I>&gt;<i> i.e. Arthur Dent (earthman)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Your Background*
</I>&gt;<i> e.g. I formally lived in the West Country before moving here due to an
</I>&gt;<i> unplanned uprooting. I am an out-of-work actor partial to hot tea and
</I>&gt;<i> dressing gowns.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Your Hacklab-related Interests*
</I>&gt;<i> e.g. I have an interest in travel and ebook reading. I enjoy hacking
</I>&gt;<i> bathtowels in new and interesting ways.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *What knowledge can you bring hacklab community?*
</I>&gt;<i> I can understand all languages known to creation and have experience with
</I>&gt;<i> very low-budget orbital hardware.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *What do you wish to learn from the hacklab community?*
</I>&gt;<i> e.g. I wish to gain more hands-on independent knowledge about electronics
</I>&gt;<i> and product design in general, so that if the world ends I can at least fix
</I>&gt;<i> my digital watch.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Link to photo (not essential but useful)*
