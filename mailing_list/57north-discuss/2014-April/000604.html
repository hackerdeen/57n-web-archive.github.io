<PRE>I'm covering a lot of things in this email. Please trim your quoting of my
email to just the relevant bit so I can follow it. If you're following up on
two unrelated points, send two emails otherwise this will get out of hand
quite quickly.

&gt;<i> In Iain's absence Carl provided pictures of some cats. One was
</I>&gt;<i> sleeping on a laptop.
</I>
Why were these vital pictures not linked in the minutes?

&gt;<i> # New member procedure
</I>
Not sure progress happened on this. Is anyone looking at it?

&gt;<i> Iain will talk to Becycle (Iain's theory that he can't be assigned
</I>&gt;<i> work when he's not here is clearly invalid).
</I>
My theory was that the meeting was last week, and that no work was assigned
to me at this month's meeting. Also, you can't assign work at meetings. It
doesn't get completed. You can only accept people volunteering.

I will delegate to Cyril though.

&gt;<i> # Themed Thursdays
</I>
If there were no volunteers at the meeting, and there was a good turnout for
the meeting (this really should be recorded in the minutes - I have no idea
how many people were there) then maybe we give up on them. Me and Tom
originally said they would only exist as long as people wanted them to
exist.

&gt;<i> Carl has lots of magswipe cards that say Aberdeen Uni - could have
</I>&gt;<i> these if we had a use for them.
</I>
These do not sound useful. Magswipe writers are prohibitively expensive.

&gt;<i> ## decision making
</I>
It seems to me that decisions aren't actually made. The important stuff gets
shoved into the next meeting, then the next, then the next, then the next,
etc.

&gt;<i> ## Where minutes go
</I>
If they're on GitHub, we should remove them from the wiki. The GitHub repo
should also have a consistent naming convention.

&gt;<i> ## Being welcoming
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We need to be more welcoming of other people to get more members.
</I>&gt;<i> There has been too much stuff on the mailing list where folks are
</I>&gt;<i> expecting too much technical ability or getting annoyed with people
</I>&gt;<i> because of overly specific expectations of what a hackspace member
</I>&gt;<i> should be. We need more members so everyone needs to try harder to be
</I>&gt;<i> friendly.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I do not expect people to have technical ability magically, but I expect
them to want to acquire it, not just go &quot;it's a hackerspace&quot; as an excuse
for shoddy work.

&gt;<i> ## Decision making
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There was some discussion about how we should be making decisions. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There was no real consensus on how this should be happening for day to
</I>&gt;<i> day decisions. Some points that were hit:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
So no decision was made on how we should make decisions?

&gt;<i>  * Anything involving spending money should go to the directors
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
It should probably go to everyone, as a discussion on the mailing list? Two
directors need to sign off on it legally, but members should also be
involved.

&gt;<i>  * Directors need a majority of them to agree to have agreement
</I>
What? Please clarify.

&gt;<i>  * For anything being looked after by someone talk to that someone.
</I>
Care to be more vague?

&gt;<i>  * Most decisions should go to the mailing list for input from other
</I>&gt;<i>    people.
</I>
Yes.

&gt;<i>  * If you suggest doing something on the mailing list and no one
</I>&gt;<i>    objects after some (undefined) reasonable amount of time then you
</I>&gt;<i>    have consensus.
</I>
Yes.

&gt;<i>  * The directors (at least) will be following the mailing list and
</I>&gt;<i>    will speak up if they have an objection.
</I>
No. The directors do not have a responsibility above other members. If
something happens and you don't like it, you should have followed the
mailing list. If you don't want to follow the mailing list, you should
contest the point about the &quot;reasonable amount of time&quot;.

&gt;<i> # No more meetings?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Trial having all discussions on the mailing list for the next month
</I>&gt;<i> with a meeting still scheduled. The meeting should just be a tick box
</I>&gt;<i> going through
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
A tick box AGM?
