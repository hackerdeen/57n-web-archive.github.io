I'd argue the agenda for this meeting should be the record of note for
when this meeting is happening and until today they said it would be
next week :)

We have definitely published two different dates in different places -
personal preference for which should be considered canonical is actually
irrelevant since there is nothing official in any one of our opinions. 

I'd say it's too late now to correct the confusion to have the meeting
today without possibly excluding people who thought it was next week.
For folks who don't get the message and turn up today we definitely can
tell them it's next week (and get their input on anything if they can't
make it then) but there is no way to reliably do that the other way
round. 

TLDR: there were/are two dates listed in different places so I'd say we
should go for the later of the two.

Instructions should be read first, or not at all.
Anything else is admitting defeat...
