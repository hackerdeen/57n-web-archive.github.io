 &gt; In Iain's absence Carl provided pictures of some cats. One was

</I>
Cat pictures are important, but I feel a specialised site should be created to 
house them. This we can share with the internet community at large.

&gt;<i> &gt; ## Being welcoming
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We need to be more welcoming of other people to get more members.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There has been too much stuff on the mailing list where folks are
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; expecting too much technical ability or getting annoyed with people
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; because of overly specific expectations of what a hackspace member
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; should be. We need more members so everyone needs to try harder to be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; friendly.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I do not expect people to have technical ability magically, but I expect
</I>&gt;<i> them to want to acquire it, not just go &quot;it's a hackerspace&quot; as an excuse
</I>&gt;<i> for shoddy work.
</I>
We should be nice to anyone no matter what. Though personally I have a very 
short fuze for people that don't want to learn. I hate having to learn when I 
want to do, so I can see where people are coming from. I lead a troubled life.

 
&gt;<i> &gt; ## Decision making
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There was some discussion about how we should be making decisions. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There was no real consensus on how this should be happening for day to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; day decisions. Some points that were hit:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So no decision was made on how we should make decisions?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  * Anything involving spending money should go to the directors
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It should probably go to everyone, as a discussion on the mailing list? Two
</I>&gt;<i> directors need to sign off on it legally, but members should also be
</I>&gt;<i> involved.
</I>
It should go to everyone, but that won't work. In the end all money related 
decisions go through me until we have a bank account. I will ask anyone that 
will listen because I **don'** want to be hated.

&gt;<i> &gt;  * Directors need a majority of them to agree to have agreement
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> What? Please clarify.
</I>
I thought it was two(2).


&gt;<i> ## AGM
</I>
&gt;<i> According to our articles of association we were supposed to have an
</I>&gt;<i> AGM in April so this will be an AGM (if the directors agree and we
</I>&gt;<i> manage to get out an announcement on time...).
</I>
This is here 
<A HREF="https://github.com/hackerdeen/articles/commit/58dc945981e15cb751968b22290e9b7f6c4ad68c#diff-8f70be4e1e768e1b1d4787a2b3ea94d5R266">https://github.com/hackerdeen/articles/commit/58dc945981e15cb751968b22290e9b7f6c4ad68c#diff-8f70be4e1e768e1b1d4787a2b3ea94d5R266</A>

I remember when the proto(We weren't a company then) directors walked through 
the articles we said this would be set to our first aniversary. 

Can some others back this up, I don't think having the AGM in May makes any
sense at all.

because nobody enables that option.
