I would argue that we should have the meeting when we said we would have the
meeting.

The sooner we can move the decision making process onto the mailing list and
away from meetings, the better.

Just because Carl can't spell &quot;agenda&quot; or work out when the third Tuesday of
the month is, and just because Rowan also can't work out when the third
Tuesday of the month is, look at OpenTechCalendar, or read the last
meeting's minutes, doesn't mean we should change the date of the meeting.

We are having the meeting today.

Rob, feel free to have a meeting next week, but you'll have to discuss it on
the mailing list first and come up with an agenda for it.

Iain.
