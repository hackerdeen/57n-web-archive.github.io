I propose the following solution: there will not be any more meetings.

If anyone feels that there are issues that need to be discussed, then
discuss them on -discuss. We will make decisions through a &quot;rough consensus&quot;
process. The consensus does not require that all participants agree although
this is, of course, preferred. In general, the dominant view of the members
that care shall prevail. (However, &quot;dominance&quot; is not to be determined on
the basis of volume or persistence, but rather a more general sense of
agreement). Consensus can be determined by a show of hands, humming, or any
other means on which those interested  agree (by rough consensus, of
course). Note that 51% of the working group does not qualify as &quot;rough
consensus&quot; and 99% is better than rough. It is up to the members that care
to determine, via rough consensus, whether or not rough consensus has been
reached.

Iain.
