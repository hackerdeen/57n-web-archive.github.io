I wasn't suggesting approval from everyone, just that there is no
overwhelming force of rejection from everyone.

I really meant clarification on what this was in relation to. If it is about
money, then we need two directors to agree to spend money, legally. It was
worded in a way that it looks like it could apply to anything.
