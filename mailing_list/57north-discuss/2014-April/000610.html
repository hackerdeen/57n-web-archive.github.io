<PRE>Hi all

Below is a proposed new member procedure. Comments/objections welcome.

[The procedure]

1. New members are asked to populate an email template (see below) and send
it to the public discussion list. They are also asked to pay 1 months
member fee at their first space visit. A director must be present to accept
this, with a receipt given.

2. Members are encouraged to email commentary to board members regarding
the new member.

3. Board members are tasked to observe any objections over a 5 day
consultation period. The initial member fee and any application objections
are registered with a tasked board member. The tasked board member is
either tasked overall, rota'ed or selected ad-hoc at the point the
application is received. If no objections are recorded from the board,
membership is deemed approved.

4. The member is notified of the outcome within 7 days of the application
date via email by the tasked board member. If accepted, info collection,
hackhub account creation and space induction is carried out by a tasked
space member. If not accepted, fees paid are returned in full by the tasked
director.

[The email]

Thank you for showing interest in joining the 57north Hacklab.

Any person who wishes to become a member of the hacklab must submit an
application for membership, along with a remittance to meet the first
month's subscription (&#163;20). The application will then be considered by the
board of directors.

We ask prospective members to make their application via an introduction
email to the public discussion list. Your membership will then be
considered by the board with member input. You will be notified 1 week or
less from the submission date whether your application was successful. Your
subscription fee will be refunded in the event of your membership not being
accepted.

Please fill in your own responses to the following items, and email them to
<A HREF="http://lists.57north.co/listinfo/57north-discuss">57north-discuss at lists.57north.co</A>

*Your Name (nick): *
i.e. Arthur Dent (earthman)

*Your Background*
e.g. I formally lived in the West Country before moving here due to an
unplanned uprooting. I am an out-of-work actor partial to hot tea and
dressing gowns.

*Your Hacklab-related Interests*
e.g. I have an interest in travel and ebook reading. I enjoy hacking
bathtowels in new and interesting ways.

*What knowledge can you bring hacklab community?*
I can understand all languages known to creation and have experience with
very low-budget orbital hardware.

*What do you wish to learn from the hacklab community?*
e.g. I wish to gain more hands-on independent knowledge about electronics
and product design in general, so that if the world ends I can at least fix
my digital watch.

*Link to photo (not essential but useful)*
