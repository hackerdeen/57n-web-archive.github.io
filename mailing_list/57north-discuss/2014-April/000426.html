That sounds worryingly present tense and vague... 

Could I ask that for future bouts of throwing things out that there be
some notice given with details of what it is that's being thrown out.
It's really easy for something rare/valuable/useful to look like junk if
it's not yours.

</I>
How many is lots? 

I took in a working (though it has some colour distortion from pressure
damage) 24&quot; one, and have the broken one from Tony that I'm still
working on (need to get some more details for the connectors and order a
new board). 

I think monitors are useful and I'd like there to be lots in the space.
If they're annoying people being on benches I could make some more
shelves to keep them on. If there is agreement that we want rid of some
I'll take them before they get thrown out. 

Robert

Instructions should be read first, or not at all.
Anything else is admitting defeat...
