The problem was not the number of monitors, the usefulness of monitors
is not being contested. The problem was that we suddenly had a lot of
monitors, did we still want to keep the broken ones?

Apparently, we do.

</I>
The stuff I was throwing away was mainly things that have been dumped,
i.e. with no owner. There was so much crap in the bits box that when I
went through it, I actually found lots of cool things but they were all
buried under crap.

&gt;<i> We are a collective, decisions need to have input from others, notice &amp;
</I>&gt;<i> some attempt at consensus.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
That's why we're having a mailing list discussion about it.

&gt;<i> I am 100% behind the decision to avoid clutter &amp; dumping of old kit, so
</I>&gt;<i> perhaps we need a longer term solution.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We could trial a designated monthly &quot;hack the space night&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
This could be a replacement for the monthly meeting.

&gt;<i> Proposal: On &quot;hack the space night&quot; any unclaimed / unlabeled kit is marked
</I>&gt;<i> for disposal (big colored label or some such) moved to a pre-designated out
</I>&gt;<i> of the way spot (under one of the desks etc perhaps with a sign)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A single photo of the pile is taken &amp; sent to the mailing list.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Members have 3 days to either claim, remove &amp; properly store the item,
</I>&gt;<i> arrange another member to do so on their behalf (if away from Aberdeen etc)
</I>&gt;<i> or it's going in the bin?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'd appreciate peoples thoughts on this, as we grow in membership, this. is
</I>&gt;<i> likely to be an ongoing issue, especially given the limited space we have
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I would suggest that any item not in a box can be put for review on the mailing list,
people have 1 week to speak up or it goes.

Iain.
