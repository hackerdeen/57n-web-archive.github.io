I do agree that doing things when they are supposed to be done is a good idea. Mistakes do happen though, so we have to take this into account.

&gt;<i> Just because Carl can't spell &quot;agenda&quot; or work out when the third Tuesday of
</I>&gt;<i> the month is, and just because Rowan also can't work out when the third
</I>&gt;<i> Tuesday of the month is, look at OpenTechCalendar, or read the last
</I>&gt;<i> meeting's minutes, doesn't mean we should change the date of the meeting.
</I>
There's no need for personal attacks, people make mistakes and things get messed up. It happens. If anyone tells you they haven't made one then they are lying.

&gt;<i> We are having the meeting today.
</I>
One person deciding things sounds more like a dictatorship than a democracy. How about we do this fairly, via a vote? I'll set one up after this. 

Cheers
Calum
