<PRE>&gt;<i> As far as I know, Tom (<A HREF="http://lists.57north.co/listinfo/57north-discuss">tom at 57north.co</A>) and Ed (<A HREF="http://lists.57north.co/listinfo/57north-discuss">ed at 57north.co</A>) will be
</I>&gt;<i> driving down and may have spare car seats. You can check with them if you
</I>&gt;<i> want to avoid the train.
</I>
I will be driving down early on the 10th and driving back up the same day.
The ORG meeting is going to be a milestone moment in the Scottish digital
rights movement. 

Right now I have four(4) empty seats, I drove to Edinburgh last week 
and I expect it to cost throughly &#163;50 including parking. Anyone that
wants to come down in my car will have to help pay for fuel and parking.
It will be a portion of that cost depending on how many people join us. 

You may also be subjected to my appalling taste in music or podcasts if
you are in my car.

The most secure code in the world is code which is never written; The
least secure code is code which is written in order to comply with a
requirement on page 70 of a 100-page standard, but never gets tested
because nobody enables that option.
