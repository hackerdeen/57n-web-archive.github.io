<PRE>Open Rights Group are well on the way to getting paid staff to help with
digital rights and privacy issues in Holyrood and Scotland.

They&#8217;ve spoken to organisations and policy makers, from the Scottish
government&#8217;s Digital Directorate through to campaigners at No2ID. They&#8217;ve
heard from digital start ups about the problems they are having with
procurement, and from academics and journalists who feel that the impact of
erosions of privacy are not being properly explained to Scottish policy
makers.

They&#8217;ve invited all the experts they&#8217;ve spoken to to a meeting on Saturday
afternoon on May 10th in Edinburgh. They've invited Charlie Stross to speak
with us, ORG staff including Jim Killock will be there, and they will talk
about issues including:

 * Entitlement cards
 * Free speech and censorship legislation in Scotland
 * Data sharing
 * Open Data, Freedom of Information and government transparency
 * Personal health data in Scotland
 * Child care data 

Can you come to the meeting? They&#8217;d like to hear from as many people as
possible, from across Scotland. It's important to know what really matters,
and what can be done about it.

<A HREF="http://www.meetup.com/ORG-Edinburgh/events/177056802/">http://www.meetup.com/ORG-Edinburgh/events/177056802/</A> 

Let them know you are coming by emailing <A HREF="http://lists.57north.co/listinfo/57north-discuss">scotland at openrightsgroup.org</A> or
joining the meet up event. And if you haven&#8217;t already, do join ORG, so that
they can pay for the new Scottish member of staff!

As far as I know, Tom (<A HREF="http://lists.57north.co/listinfo/57north-discuss">tom at 57north.co</A>) and Ed (<A HREF="http://lists.57north.co/listinfo/57north-discuss">ed at 57north.co</A>) will be
driving down and may have spare car seats. You can check with them if you
want to avoid the train.

Iain.
