For much the same reason that I don't think we should be having the
meeting today I don't think a vote with a two hour window should be
deciding anything: it excludes anyone who isn't online right now. 

I will be at the space this evening, and will be pushing to postpone the
meeting to next week. If there isn't consensus on that then we get to
have two meetings... And then possibly another one to try and reconcile
any differing outcomes from the two...

It's not the end of the world either way.

Instructions should be read first, or not at all.
Anything else is admitting defeat...
