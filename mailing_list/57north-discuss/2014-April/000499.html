Hi Tony,

Without knowing what each server actually draws, max load was the only thing I had to go on when I did these quickly at 1 in the morning. They assume that the server is in its worst possible loading condition, so it's taking the full power available from the output - max stall load. 

I think the main constraints we are going to have are the wiring in the building and the loading capacity of the floor. Without looking at both I can't give an accurate figure accurate figure beyond 8, as the MSL may exceed the wiring specification. It loos like the building may the biggest factor in the selection.

Regards
Calum
