I've come to the conclusion that there is something wrong with the card
reader. It just gives errors connected to doorbot, connected to my
laptop it gave errors and sometimes gave card numbers, connected to
other machines it sometimes worked properly (from limited testing it
looked to be fine on a Macbook if anyone wants to donate one of them to
take over as doorbot). 

I am able to unlock the door via the internet though so if anybody wants
in in the near future I might be able to help without actually turning
up with keys - otherwise poke one of the keyholders.

Longer term I'm thinking of replacing the card reader with a page on
hackhub (possibly with a local backup for if the internet has gone away)
that unlocks the door. Would anybody be likely to be turning up at the
space without a device they could use to hit that page (you can get on
the space wifi from outside the door)?

Instructions should be read first, or not at all.
Anything else is admitting defeat...
