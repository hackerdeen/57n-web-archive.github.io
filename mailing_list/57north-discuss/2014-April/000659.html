You could, but I'd rather it wasn't. We've invited groups like Becycle and
other hackerspaces around Scotland to come along and I'd like them to have
an equal oppertunity to get involved.

Members of 57North are organising the event, but it definitely shouldn't be
exclusive to 57North members, nor even people that live in Aberdeen.

If it's posted on the 57North facebook, it should also be posted on other
Scottish hackerspaces pages and such.

If we had a better toilet, this wouldn't be an issue, because then we
wouldn't have to care so much about the numbers, but the toilet is a
limiting factor.

As it stands, I think we will sell out quite quickly already. I've met lots
of interested people.

Iain.
