</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Tuesday nights, including but not limited to social contact,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; programming, manufacturing weird things and consuming sugary treats.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We usually begin at about 7, but sometimes someone will be in earlier.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; anything, ask in IRC[1]. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If you're new, I'd suggest you bring a laptop, and perhaps a project
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you want to work on. If you're coming in, feel free to reply and tell
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; us all what you're planning to do!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I will be in flailing at something... probably. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I will be in, doing something with computers probably (safe bet).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Our visitor from Saturday said he might come by, if he does you all
</I>&gt;<i> should ask lots of questions. Stavagner manages a makerspace with 1500
</I>&gt;<i> on the books members and 300 active members. The population of Stavanger
</I>&gt;<i> is half the size of Aberdeen.
