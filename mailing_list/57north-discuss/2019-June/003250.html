<PRE>Hello Jayne 

I guess the thing is what can we do for you? The only meter for the cut us enthusiasm, but Ed may be more choosy ;)

The Luftdaten project will welcome more people

&gt;<i> 1. Your Name (nick):
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Jayne
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Your Background
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 'A leisurely walk through the sciences' is how I explain my lack of direction in my undergrad studies - Astrophysics to Atmospheric physics along
</I>&gt;<i> side Materials Engineering, then changed to materials science. While I was learning about our atmosphere I got very passionate about mitigating
</I>&gt;<i> anthropologically forced climate change (obvs) so i transferred to sustainable energy management, then I was finding that a bit bland and not
</I>&gt;<i> scientific enough so I transferred (again) to an undergrad BSc in Physics and Nanotechnology (which I just finished, yay!) and I have one more unit
</I>&gt;<i> to complete my minor in computational and applied mathematics... so as you can imagine that is fun to explain in a job interview...... open to
</I>&gt;<i> suggestions on masters.. its between an MBA and a nanotech masters right now... PhD next! (hopefully, someday...)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Professionally - I have started up businesses with my family off the back of our core business (printing), and have worked in start ups and NGOs in
</I>&gt;<i> Melbourne (Aus, where im from) so im really keen to get involved in this area again.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I currently work in O&amp;G as a data analyst (trying to 'change it from the inside....' ask me how that is going.....) and have some good skills in data
</I>&gt;<i> and engineering etc but still a ways to go.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Your Hacklab-related Interests
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I went along to the Code the City event at aberdeen uni for the LuftDaten sensors - It was really challenging and we didn't get as far as I thought
</I>&gt;<i> we would, and im really stubborn so want to keep on going with it. It was great to be able to improve my python skills along side some really
</I>&gt;<i> brilliant people and I felt really energised to be back in the 'start up vibe' kinda environment.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 4. What knowledge can you bring hacklab community?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would love to bring my ideas and passion for technology to the community, and hopefully contribute towards your collective goals.I have been in
</I>&gt;<i> Aberdeen 5 years now and haven't really found a 'community of like minded souls' so I would love to get to know your community and contribute with
</I>&gt;<i> enthusiasm, and burgeoning knowledge of data. I work as a data analyst in my day to day - and try to empower all of my colleagues with the power of
</I>&gt;<i> data, always sending the message that 'data is easy and fun' as opposed to data is exclusive and unattainable.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> From the two sessions I have done in your space I feel the openness of thoughts and ideas which I really admire.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 5. What do you wish to learn from the hacklab community?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> More about everything tech and data - I want to use this as a time to practice python, continue the luftdaten project (and remember to update the
</I>&gt;<i> GitHub, and learn how to use GitHub properly :D )
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 6. Link to photo (not essential but useful)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> [1]<A HREF="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jayne-macleod-copeland-bba44842/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/jayne-macleod-copeland-bba44842/</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks All, hope I make the cut :D
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> (p.s. better edward?!? haha)

</I>&gt;<i> Jayne
