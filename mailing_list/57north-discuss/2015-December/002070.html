Subject: [57north-announce] Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday.

Hello Everyone.


It Is Tuesday and it is our Openday.

Please Everyone drop by if you can and, bring a friend if you can, Tell
us what you will be doing if you can, and be happy if you can.


I'll be down to work more on Doorbot. I'll be there at about 18:00.


Also, does anyone something to transfer MiniDV to digital I don't have
the tapes yet but the person I am getting them from says they are in HP
format, though I have not managed to find out what that is. Any help
would be much appreciated


Doc.
