Subject: food hacking base crowdsourcing campaign at 32c3 support and
promote
Date: Thu, 10 Dec 2015 20:12:33 +0900
From: Frantisek Algoldor Apfelbeck &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.57north.co/listinfo/57north-discuss">algoldor at foodhackingbase.org</A>&gt;


the end of the year is approaching so is therefore 32c3 and like in the
past years Food Hacking Base plans to be there. We are running another
crowdsourcing campaign which is going to secure our resources needed to
participate at this event. As usually we get in touch with our formal
contributors which you with your support of &#8364;100 for CCC Camp 2015
definitely are (I hope you have enjoyed our main support perk access to
all :-)). If you are happy with what we have done with your help before
we would be very happy to get your support again and of course the best
would be you sharing your time during 32c3 with us in person.

<A HREF="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/food-hacking-base-in-hamburg-during-32c3-with-you#/">https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/food-hacking-base-in-hamburg-during-32c3-with-you#/</A>

Before you consider donating you should know that this year will be
quite challenging for us  concerning organizing our food&amp;drink
activities because they have been all prohibited by CCC orga - to handle
and hand out any foods&amp;drinks at the CCH building by Food Hacking Base
at 32c3 is strictly prohibited. We will be present at the congress
building anyway doing variety of other non prohibited activities but our
traditional activities has to be done somewhere else, we are securing a
nearby location to CCH. This campaign therefore will be quite to a
degree about supporting the concept and long term work of our group
understanding that we have to do quite plenty of extra effort to make it
happen this time. We are going to do our best to provide what we have
helped to integrate into the hacker movement through the years taking
the hard road. There are however people coming who were preparing their
ferments and food delights for months by now and at some cases if we
were not present they would not come at all. Especially for these
hardcore food&amp;drink hackers we are making this extra effort.

Long story short, we will be both at the congress building doing what we
can there and the rest will be done somewhere else near by. It is your
support which we will need to make it happen and yes it will be worth of
it!

Sincerely for Food Hacking Base,

Frantisek Algoldor Apfelbeck
