I'll be along. I think I'll be playing with Pi0's to see if I can come
up with an actual use for them.

&gt;<i> Also, does anyone something to transfer MiniDV to digital I don't have

</I>
The pedantic bastard in me insists that I point out miniDV is already
digital, so no transfer needed to achieve that :)

I've got an old miniDV camera, and if I can find all the cables can
hook it up to a computer to capture from tapes. It is standard def 4:3
though so might not be compatible (if it was shot on a camera from
this century).

There are services to grab stuff from tape that might be less hassle
than trying to find a compatible camera/player,
e.g. <A HREF="http://www.videos-dvd.co.uk/Transfer-Copy/MiniDV_Video.html">http://www.videos-dvd.co.uk/Transfer-Copy/MiniDV_Video.html</A> 
A quick google found plenty of others.
