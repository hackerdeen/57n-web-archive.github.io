This is a -discuss list, therefore I will discuss.

High-tech is a funny term.

&gt;<i> In this role you&#8217;ll be responsible for the day to day management of the MAKE

</I>&gt;<i> stakeholders and the University. You&#8217;ll already hold a degree in a Design/
</I>&gt;<i> Architecture/ Engineering discipline and will have previous experience of
</I>&gt;<i> delivering excellent customer service, as well as CAD design and design

Sounds like the 'new' Make will operate that same difficult to manage hours.
There is a weird tear here between me wanting a resource that I don't have to
leave work to use and not forcing someone into working shitty hours.

Thankfully the space is available all hours and no one has to baby sit you.

&gt;<i> There are a restricted number of certificates of sponsorship available in the
</I>&gt;<i> UK and there is no guarantee that the University would be able to obtain one
</I>&gt;<i> should the successful candidate require one. 
</I>
I am not a hr drone, could someone explain this paragraph?

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Salary: &#163;23619-&#163;25769

</I>&gt;<i> Closing Date: 18 December 2015 
</I>
This isn't a good deal, this is what you would make running a corner super
market.

Anti social hours usually dictate financial benefits, this position doesn't
seem to. Maybe I am unreasonable, but this as described is not a good job offer.
