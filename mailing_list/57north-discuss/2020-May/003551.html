<PRE>Wouter

PCB antennas can be very directional, in recent EMC testing of a BLE 
2.4ghz modified F antenna I had a difference of circa 10dB as you 
rotated the pcb around 360 degrees, with even worse above and below the 
plane of the PCB antenna.

If within any casing you have is there room to rotate the PCB, that 
might help.
Daft question: Not having seen the mount is it on a pole or similar that 
can be rotated 90 degrees in the vertical plane.

Does your router allow you to survey local access points (I use a 
draytek which will do a scan of all the bands so you can see what is 
around you and on what chaannels) with a view to chnaging the 2.4ghz 
channel. Not fail safe as some routers will do dynamic selection - i.e. 
at start will look at choose a channel based on current use. Also some 
systems are better away from top and bottom channels.
