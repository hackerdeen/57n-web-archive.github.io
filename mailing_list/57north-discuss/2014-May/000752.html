<PRE>Hi,

I'm a director of 57North Hacklab[1] and we're looking at running some
entry-level workshops for those that want to get involved in hacking[2]. We
will be aiming for these workshops to be as inclusive as possible.

[2]: <A HREF="http://www.mail-archive.com/57north-discuss@lists.57north.co/msg00494.html">http://www.mail-archive.com/57north-discuss@lists.57north.co/msg00494.html</A>

We would also be interested in getting involved in your group in Aberdeen,
helping to promote the events and possibly helping to run them (we are all
volunteers, so no guarantees). The Aberdeen group is listed as active, but
there are no upcoming events, does this mean we were active but since died?

We exist, we've now discovered that you exist, and maybe we can work
together. Let me know what you think.

Iain.
