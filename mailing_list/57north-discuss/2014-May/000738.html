<PRE>This use case has come up again. Someone wants to know if the space is
open. (Publicly posted on our Facebook page)

I am at home on mobile devices and I cant tell them. Why?

1) the mobile version of the site a) does not show the status
b) does not show social media to get to twitter
c) provide me an option to view desktop mode

2) after Googling to get the twitter,  it doesn't appear to show any tweets
about opening and closing since a week ago.

This needs sorted ASAP.  All this doing and not talking.. this is a website
built on a platform I have no access to and probably no clue what to do to
implement these changes unlike something like wordpress.

While we are at it. How do people know how to get in ? Verbal 'oh you click
the button on the hub' is not any sort of solution. This needs documented
so members are all aware of how to get in.

I have mentioned these things in passing before,  this is me saying they
need sorted. And if I can help (without some massive list of instructions
and keys) then I want too, and would be doing it first thing in the morning
(or months ago).

I look forward to the responses in order to get a solution in place asap.

I will now tell a potential new member that I dont know if the space is
open, and apologise for twitter not showing the info.

Thanks,
Rowan
