The Edinburgh group are more active, younger and geekier as they are part
of the start up scene there, whereas Aberdeen ones as Rowan notes are
older professionals in IT as that&#185;s what we have here at the moment. Let
me know if you want to get in touch with Edinburgh folks. I&#185;m friends with
Morna Simpson who founded GirlGeeks and also Victoria Thomas, who&#185;s taken
over running it for now.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Be interesting to see where it goes. And yeah they haven't been active
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> much in a while.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>My main reason for reaching out to these groups is to ensure we're not
</I>&gt;<i>duplicating effort and/or stepping on any toes. If, as you say, they were
</I>&gt;<i>making jokes about geeks that weren't cool, it sounds like they may have
</I>&gt;<i>actually been doing more harm than good. Maybe there are new volunteers to
</I>&gt;<i>run events that would make a better go at it.
