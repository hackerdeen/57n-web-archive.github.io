<PRE>Hi Rowan

Good to raise this, I had no idea Twitter was not recording.

Re site - I''ll code up something for Iain to put up on the site tomorrow -
just needs an adjustment. In meantime, use
<A HREF="http://www.bastinat0r.de:3000/#57north">http://www.bastinat0r.de:3000/#57north</A>

Re Twitter, Tom will likely look into that when he's next near an internet
connection. He wrote the connector and to my knowledge no others have
volunteered to co-maintain it.

Re enterence method - it's a good excuse for you and I to meet up and
complete the new member procedure / induction we were tasked with. I have
researched and written a complete new member procedure, got member comments
and cleared it with the board, so we just need the induction part. That
will serve as a manual for present members also.

When can we both be at the space to finish this? I'm good most days. It can
be done remotely o/c but nothing beats being physically at the space to get
our focus on.

Cheers
Ed

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1) the mobile version of the site a) does not show the status

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have mentioned these things in passing before,  this is me saying they

</I>&gt;<i> (or months ago).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I look forward to the responses in order to get a solution in place asap.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I will now tell a potential new member that I dont know if the space is
</I>&gt;<i> open, and apologise for twitter not showing the info.
