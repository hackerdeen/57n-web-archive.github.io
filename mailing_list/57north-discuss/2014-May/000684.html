<PRE>Hack N Make is this Sundae. 

Set up for HnM starts tomorrow at 1700. Right now we don't have anything 
that advertises the space. If some one could make a few banners tomorrow that
would be awesome. 

HnM runs on Sunday from 0900-1600, Elphinstone Hall, King's College, The
University of Aberdeen. We will be allowed in from 0800 to straighten up our
booth. We have to be out of Elphinstone before 1700, there is another event
running.

Unfortunately most of the people that have told me they are coming along to
help are going to are also coming to Edinburgh tomorrow to help protect your
freedom.

That means the usual suspects won't be able to help with prep until Saturday
evening.  There are a few simple things that could be made that will make our
booth not look like shit.

	* 57 North Banners
	* Flyers of some sort
	* Signage stuff

Probably lots of other things too. 

I am taking a teletype that is in my office and will be trying to make it work 
on Sunday.


All times are in BST(UTC+1). Dates are in the Gregorian calendar. Unless otherwise
specified locations discussed are in Scotland, Earth, The Milky way Galaxy,
Universe 4.

I don't see how we are going to build the dystopian megapoli we were promised 
in 80s and early 90s cyberpunk fiction if you guys keep complaining.
