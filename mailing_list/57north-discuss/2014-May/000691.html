<PRE>Those of you that were paying attention to Twitter will notice that some
57North members were in Edinburgh today (let's pretend I did find time to
send this while it was still Saturday).

Open Rights Group exists to preserve and promote your rights in the digital
age. In order to tackle issues arising due to legislation (or lack of) in
Scotland, ORG are looking to hire someone to work on Scottish issues.

The meetup was primarily a discussion with the aim of discovering the issues
that are threatening our digital freedom in Scotland and where ORG Scotland
will focus its efforts.

The following issues have been identified:

 * Scottish National Entitlement Card
 * Getting It Right For Every Child
 * NHS Scotland Data Sharing
 * Government Transparency (Open Data, etc.)
 * Censorship and Libel Laws

Organisations that ORG Scotland should work with that are already operating
in Scotland, although either with wider (general human rights) or tighter
(single issue) focus, were also identified.

ORG will be sending someone to attend the next TechMeetup and you can learn
more about their work there.

I will be looking at organising a monthly meetup for those that want to
discuss issues of digital freedom and open source issues that can hopefully,
to some extent, be supported by ORG and FSFE.

For now though, if you're wondering what you can do to help, you can join
ORG as a supporter:

  <A HREF="https://www.openrightsgroup.org/join/">https://www.openrightsgroup.org/join/</A>

You can join for just &#163;5 a year, although if you give at least &#163;5 a month
you'll recieve a free t-shirt and some stickers so you can help spread the
word too.

Iain.
