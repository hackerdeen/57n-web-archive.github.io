</I>&gt;<i> Good to raise this, I had no idea Twitter was not recording.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>None of us spotted it :p I still wouldn't have without someone having put
in a request to know the status

&gt;<i>  Re site - I''ll code up something for Iain to put up on the site
</I>&gt;<i> tomorrow - just needs an adjustment. In meantime, use
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.bastinat0r.de:3000/#57north">http://www.bastinat0r.de:3000/#57north</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Im not sure if its my work network, but I see little on the page (my work
is notorios for hiding things in pages with no visual feedback that it is
doing so )

&gt;<i> Re Twitter, Tom will likely look into that when he's next near an internet
</I>&gt;<i> connection. He wrote the connector and to my knowledge no others have
</I>&gt;<i> volunteered to co-maintain it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I don't think I have the knowledge to maintain, but it would be good to
brainstorm ideas of finding out when it might have gone down.

&gt;<i> Re enterence method - it's a good excuse for you and I to meet up and
</I>&gt;<i> complete the new member procedure / induction we were tasked with. I have
</I>&gt;<i> researched and written a complete new member procedure, got member comments
</I>&gt;<i> and cleared it with the board, so we just need the induction part. That
</I>&gt;<i> will serve as a manual for present members also.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When can we both be at the space to finish this? I'm good most days. It
</I>&gt;<i> can be done remotely o/c but nothing beats being physically at the space to
</I>&gt;<i> get our focus on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Definitely agree. I was a bit confused by the member procedure because it
was more of an induction and sales-ish pitch I had been thinking of. So
yes, great to get started on that side of things. All a bit hectic at the
moment with website deployments and client meetings in the evenings. But
how about next Thursday before I host Themed Thursday Munchkin night ?

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>  This use case has come up again. Someone wants to know if the space is

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I am at home on mobile devices and I cant tell them. Why?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1) the mobile version of the site a) does not show the status
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> b) does not show social media to get to twitter
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> c) provide me an option to view desktop mode
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2) after Googling to get the twitter,  it doesn't appear to show any
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tweets about opening and closing since a week ago.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This needs sorted ASAP.  All this doing and not talking.. this is a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> website built on a platform I have no access to and probably no clue what
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to do to implement these changes unlike something like wordpress.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> While we are at it. How do people know how to get in ? Verbal 'oh you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> click the button on the hub' is not any sort of solution. This needs
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> documented so members are all aware of how to get in.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have mentioned these things in passing before,  this is me saying they
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> need sorted. And if I can help (without some massive list of instructions
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and keys) then I want too, and would be doing it first thing in the morning
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (or months ago).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I look forward to the responses in order to get a solution in place asap.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I will now tell a potential new member that I dont know if the space is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> open, and apologise for twitter not showing the info.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks,
