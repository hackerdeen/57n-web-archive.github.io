That's a shame, although maybe it was just the people running it in
Aberdeen. The Edinburgh group does look to be doing good things. I guess if
the word hacking scares them off, we won't hear back from them but we also
won't have lost out.

My main reason for reaching out to these groups is to ensure we're not
duplicating effort and/or stepping on any toes. If, as you say, they were
making jokes about geeks that weren't cool, it sounds like they may have
actually been doing more harm than good. Maybe there are new volunteers to
run events that would make a better go at it.

Iain.
