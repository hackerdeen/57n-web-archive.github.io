<PRE>I'd noticed that twitter had stopped reporting maybe last
week, but given I get the announcements from irc I'd just kind of not
noticed it was happening.

Note to future self: Report things before forgetting about them.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Good to raise this, I had no idea Twitter was not recording.

</I>&gt;<i> None of us spotted it :p I still wouldn't have without someone having put
</I>&gt;<i> in a request to know the status
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  Re site - I''ll code up something for Iain to put up on the site
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tomorrow - just needs an adjustment. In meantime, use

</I>&gt;<i> Im not sure if its my work network, but I see little on the page (my work
</I>&gt;<i> is notorios for hiding things in pages with no visual feedback that it is
</I>&gt;<i> doing so )
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Re Twitter, Tom will likely look into that when he's next near an internet
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; connection. He wrote the connector and to my knowledge no others have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; volunteered to co-maintain it.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> I don't think I have the knowledge to maintain, but it would be good to
</I>&gt;<i> brainstorm ideas of finding out when it might have gone down.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Re enterence method - it's a good excuse for you and I to meet up and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; complete the new member procedure / induction we were tasked with. I have
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; researched and written a complete new member procedure, got member comments
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and cleared it with the board, so we just need the induction part. That
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; will serve as a manual for present members also.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; When can we both be at the space to finish this? I'm good most days. It
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; can be done remotely o/c but nothing beats being physically at the space to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; get our focus on.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Definitely agree. I was a bit confused by the member procedure because it
</I>&gt;<i> was more of an induction and sales-ish pitch I had been thinking of. So
</I>&gt;<i> yes, great to get started on that side of things. All a bit hectic at the
</I>&gt;<i> moment with website deployments and client meetings in the evenings. But
</I>&gt;<i> how about next Thursday before I host Themed Thursday Munchkin night ?

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;  This use case has come up again. Someone wants to know if the space is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; open. (Publicly posted on our Facebook page)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I am at home on mobile devices and I cant tell them. Why?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 1) the mobile version of the site a) does not show the status
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; b) does not show social media to get to twitter
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; c) provide me an option to view desktop mode
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 2) after Googling to get the twitter,  it doesn't appear to show any
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; tweets about opening and closing since a week ago.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; This needs sorted ASAP.  All this doing and not talking.. this is a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; website built on a platform I have no access to and probably no clue what
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; to do to implement these changes unlike something like wordpress.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; While we are at it. How do people know how to get in ? Verbal 'oh you
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; click the button on the hub' is not any sort of solution. This needs
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; documented so members are all aware of how to get in.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I have mentioned these things in passing before,  this is me saying they
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; need sorted. And if I can help (without some massive list of instructions
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; and keys) then I want too, and would be doing it first thing in the morning
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; (or months ago).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I look forward to the responses in order to get a solution in place asap.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I will now tell a potential new member that I dont know if the space is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; open, and apologise for twitter not showing the info.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Rowan
