I'm guessing this is IET. Not sure if IEEE and IET get along together well
but as long as they do, I think it would be good to get them involved.

Some things I would be happy to run workshops about are:

 * Python
 * Analog electronics
 * Computer networking
 * Working in the Linux shell

I've put up a wiki page[1] that we can use to collect resources to take this
forward. Once we have a few volunteers for a topic, we can look at doing one
event and then if successful, do more, or if not, fix the format and try
again.
