I have 5 boxes here, please someone come with a car and take them to the
space.

I will be in, forcing a blinkenlights screen on Ed and reading some
driver code.

On that, we need to figure the break down of tasks for this year. If
anyone wants to help on a group project in the space, this is a great
place to help.
