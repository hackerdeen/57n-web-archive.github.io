The network will have a rough location for it based on which mast it
last connected to (and maybe which other masts could see it, and signal
strength at each). But I don't think you have much chance of getting
them to give you that info... if you've nothing better to do it might be
fun to try and get it out of them. Could try the subject access stuff of
the data protection act?
