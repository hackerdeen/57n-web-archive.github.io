<PRE>Hi all,

If you know anyone or are interested yourself, please email! Thanks all.

---------------
A full time opportunity has arisen within the SureVoIP technical team
in Aberdeen for a Junior Technical Administrator.

The office based role will include:

* You will support existing clients, resolve problems and implement new onsite
and hosted VoIP systems
* Answer support enquiries from website contact form, via our website
chat tool and via telephone
* You will provision new systems for customers
* You will sometimes need to travel to client sites to perform deployment,
implementation and support activities, so a driving licence and car are a big
plus. You will however have a direct supervisor to lead you through all this.
* Technologies you'll get exposure to over time; Linux (Debian, CentOS), JunOS,
  FreeSWITCH, OpenSIPS, Asterisk, PostgreSQL, MySQL/MariaDB, Proxmox,
  Grafana, InfluxDB, ElasticSearch Logstash, Apache, Nginx, Git/Gitlab, Redmine,
  RT, PowerDNS, Dovecot, Exim,  OpenLDAP, Nagios, Observium, FreeRADIUS,
  Ansible, MQTT, ZeroMQ, Jenkins CI, GitLab, WebRTC and XMPP.

Experience:

Ideally, you'll have worked with a Linux desktop in customer-facing
role and/or have a
working knowledge of a Linux environment. You may not have experience with
all of the technologies and procedures mentioned above, but you need to show
that you are capable of understanding and deploying them in a professional
environment. You should have general TCP/IP networking and Linux administration
experience and be able to talk to clients on the phone. You will be put through
a VoIP (SIP) training course, but existing Linux skills are essential.

You will possess excellent communication skills, be able to prioritise
a busy workload, and liaise closely with those in the support team to ensure
excellent customer support is delivered at all times.

Salary: £Competitive
Deadline: 20th January 2017

About SureVoIP

Based in the city’s Bridge of Don area, SureVoIP specialises in using
the internet
to deliver telecoms – more commonly known as VoIP or voice-over
internet protocol.
The company services the VoIP telephony requirements of more than
1,000 companies
of varying size, from multinational oil majors to national charities.

Established in 2011, SureVoIP is a carrier-grade VoIP provider and delivers its
service over the firm’s own wholly owned and managed systems. The company, which
offers the reassurance of a UK-based technical support team available via phone,
email or webchat, is regulated by Ofcom and holds its own Ofcom number ranges.

SureVoIP runs its own MPLS enabled network which is designed for Voice-over IP
(VoIP). It does this to allow the company to be independent of any one supplier,
for quality and control.

This network is spread across two sites for redundancy and high availability,
and within these sites there is also redundancy and high availability. One site
is in London Docklands (Telehouse East) and the other is in Edinburgh
(Pulsant South Gyle).

In June 2016, SureVoIP won the Internet Telephony Service Provider
Association’s (ITSPA)
UK-wide award for Best Business ITSP (Medium Enterprise). The company was also a
finalist in the Best Business ITSP (Corporate) and Best VoIP
Infrastructure categories.
In October 2016, the company was nominated for the Best Enterprise
Cloud Solution
and the Best Hosted Platform honours as part of the Comms National Awards 2016.
