Hi, Will.

Been there, done that, got the T-shirt :-)

In 1984-87 I worked for the MRC CAPCU at the Western General Hospital in 
Edinburgh and ran Unix Version 7 on pdp11's, the BSD Unix on Vaxen. For 
a while, I ran the UK MUGNET node on a pdp11/23 and brought in Usenet 
newsgroups like 'hacktic' from the Netherlands.

&gt;<i> These days we have a small consulting firm &lt;https:/situgyan.com&gt;.
</I>
Interesting: I have a one-man bioinformatics consultany:

   <A HREF="http://minke-informatics.co.uk/">http://minke-informatics.co.uk</A>

I've donated a lot of time and hardware to the Mario Negri Institute in 
Milan where I run a Linux HPC compute and storage cluster running 
LizardFS SDS. The work I've been supporting is cancer genomics.

&gt;<i> I have been learning to manage Nextcloud, Matrix, and Moodle with an
</I>&gt;<i> LDAP backend, and administering Debian. I believe firmly that NGOs and
</I>&gt;<i> charities should be supported to thrive with community-supported software.
</I>
Indeed, take a look at Debian-Med if you don't already know about it:

&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-med/">https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-med/</A>
</I>
This is the software I use for bioinformatics work.

&gt;<i> I am trying to encourage my children to learn practical computing skills
</I>&gt;<i> - we've got Raspis around the house, an OpenHAB instance, and other
</I>&gt;<i> goodies, and I'm finally learning Lisp properly together with the sprogs.
</I>
I learned enough about Lisp not to use it, while studying for a 
part-time AI MSc at UoA many years ago. Jacked that in and studied 
bioinformatics instead, which was much more useful to me as a biologist.

&gt;<i> Family obligations mean it's not likely I will actually be a physical
</I>&gt;<i> presence around the lab much, but we are nearby.
</I>
I stay outside Aberdeen, so don't always attend the Hackspace meetings. 
However, we are a friendly group and it's nice to meet up from time to time.

Bye,

   Tony.
