<PRE>Ah oooopss.. O/c by &quot;getting clearence to drive abroad with COVID&quot; I
mean with the COVID situation as it is, not actually having it. Thanks
to the relentless preparation of my lovely partner, I have probably
been through enough COVID test strips to build a model space probe.

Cheers,
Ed

Goes without saying I'll be in :) I'll be aiming to finish some
(alright maybe just one) of the 'nearly finished' wee projects that I
have racked up over the past 10 years in Aberdeen.

On reflection over the stress of arranging work permits, mothballing
houses, packing and getting clearence to drive abroad with COVID;
having familiar projects to finish up has been wonderful therapy.
Having a neat place to work on them whilst my tools are packed, doubly
so.

If you are lucky enough to have a vast pile of nearly done projects
and some free time this eve, I recommend popping over to the space for
some warm-hearted social marvelling upon your procrastination skills.
Of course this comes along with the standard encouragement and
interest in your efforts that fellow hackers show by default in spaces
like ours. It's awesome.

See you there :)
Ed
