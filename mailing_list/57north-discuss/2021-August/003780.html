<PRE>I was going to suggest a cake from Costco, but as submissions from email aren't being considered this can be disregarded.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hi All!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It's been ages since we had a social event, so let's hang out and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; celebrate Free Software projects!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; A lot of Free Software projects have had major releases this year. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; To name a few that members of the hacklab are excited by or involved in: 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   * Debian[1] released version 11 just last week and I'm excited
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   * FreeBSD[2] released version 13 in April, and tj is excited.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   * OpenBSD[3] had their 50th major release, 6.9, in May and irl is excited.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   * Joomla[4] has released version 4 this week and Andyg is excited! 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;   * Fedora[5] release 34 in April and I'm sure someone is excited?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If you are contributing to these projects, ! If I've missed the one 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that you're excited by, I'm sorry, just reply and tell us! 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Let's gather at the space on Sunday, 22nd August at 3pm and talk about 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; our favorite free software projects and why they're cool. Presentations 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (in ODP) in 3 part harmony are not mandatory! 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I will probably try and BBQ some food at 5/6pm as a stand in for 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; &quot;dinner&quot; - you are welcome to do the same! This depends on the weather, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; which is currently listed as &quot;overcast&quot;. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'll be bringing some beer, but there is also a great new coffee 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; machine (espresso and drip) that was gifted by Marcel and tea-making 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; facilities available as normal. Be sure to bring some ground beans!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Should people want, I can restock the shop with club mate and other 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; soft drinks also!
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; If you plan to come in and play, shoot a message to the mailing list. 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I think we're all happy for you to bring friends/others to the space, 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and but remember that as this event is open to the public, the wearing 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; of a face covering while &quot;not seated, eating or drinking&quot; is a legal 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; requirement.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The worst case scenario is that I'm on my own at 57N BBQing food and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; drinking beer for an afternoon/evening while working on space 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; infrastructure projects, it's not such a bad life.
