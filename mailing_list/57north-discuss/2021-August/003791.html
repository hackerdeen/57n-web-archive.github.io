<PRE>Hi
Sadly I can't make it along this evening, though it was awesome to see
about a dozen folk in the space last Tuesday.
Sofa sounds good, thanks Mike :) hope all's well.
Cheers
Andy

&gt;<i> Do you want a sofa? - 2 seat, leather, not new but not bad condition.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi All,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Aberdeen City remains at protection level QUANTUM DRY, which means we can
</I>&gt;<i> invite all interested to today's OPEN TUESDAY. We typically start around
</I>&gt;<i> 7pm and remain at our location in Unit H, Kettock Lodge, Campus Two,
</I>&gt;<i> Innovation Park, AB22 8GU.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'll be in between 730-8pm, replacing the PEI sheet on the Lulzbot Mini
</I>&gt;<i> and maybe pondering the wiki, mailing lists and other bits n bobs no doubt.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Reminder: MPD is back, baby! You can control it via the web, ncmpcpp or
</I>&gt;<i> probably some other methods. It plays music to snapcast by default, but
</I>&gt;<i> also an http stream!
</I>&gt;<i> You can upload what you want to it, but don't take up too much space!
</I>&gt;<i> Learn more on the wiki[1].
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you're coming in today, consider sending a reply!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now begins the important COVID information transmission, please pay
</I>&gt;<i> attention:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We are participating in the Scottish Government's contact tracing
</I>&gt;<i> programme. You will find purple posters at the entrance to the space and
</I>&gt;<i> around the space that contain QR codes. Please scan the QR code and provide
</I>&gt;<i> your contact details. If you are unable to scan a QR code, there is a link
</I>&gt;<i> to type into your browser. If you cannot use the link, ask someone else to
</I>&gt;<i> check in for you and provide them with your email address and phone number.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please note that contact tracing is a requirement of participating in an
</I>&gt;<i> Open Tuesday in person, and is not negotiable. If you do not provide
</I>&gt;<i> tracing details you will be asked to leave.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As we emerge from this global disaster, some will understandably be
</I>&gt;<i> cautious about being in new spaces. Please respect people's boundaries by
</I>&gt;<i> maintaining social distancing and wearing a mask as you move around the
</I>&gt;<i> space. If you are sat down, you can take off your mask to have easier
</I>&gt;<i> access to your face if needed for eating or drinking. Use common sense and
</I>&gt;<i> remember this is a shared space.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As this event is open to the public, the wearing of a face covering while
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;not seated, eating or drinking&quot; is a LEGAL REQUIREMENT.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you are in early, open windows to get air flowing through the space. It
</I>&gt;<i> could be a good idea to bring a jumper or something as the space could be a
</I>&gt;<i> little cooler than you might expect because of this.
