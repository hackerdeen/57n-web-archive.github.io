<PRE>I'll be in. As it's a party I may bring a cake. Suggestions for type of cake are welcome in IRC.

&gt;<i> Hi All!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's been ages since we had a social event, so let's hang out and 
</I>&gt;<i> celebrate Free Software projects!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> A lot of Free Software projects have had major releases this year. 
</I>&gt;<i> To name a few that members of the hacklab are excited by or involved in: 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>   * Debian[1] released version 11 just last week and I'm excited
</I>&gt;<i>   * FreeBSD[2] released version 13 in April, and tj is excited.
</I>&gt;<i>   * OpenBSD[3] had their 50th major release, 6.9, in May and irl is excited.
</I>&gt;<i>   * Joomla[4] has released version 4 this week and Andyg is excited! 
</I>&gt;<i>   * Fedora[5] release 34 in April and I'm sure someone is excited?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you are contributing to these projects, ! If I've missed the one 
</I>&gt;<i> that you're excited by, I'm sorry, just reply and tell us! 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Let's gather at the space on Sunday, 22nd August at 3pm and talk about 
</I>&gt;<i> our favorite free software projects and why they're cool. Presentations 
</I>&gt;<i> (in ODP) in 3 part harmony are not mandatory! 
</I>&gt;<i> I will probably try and BBQ some food at 5/6pm as a stand in for 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;dinner&quot; - you are welcome to do the same! This depends on the weather, 
</I>&gt;<i> which is currently listed as &quot;overcast&quot;. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'll be bringing some beer, but there is also a great new coffee 
</I>&gt;<i> machine (espresso and drip) that was gifted by Marcel and tea-making 
</I>&gt;<i> facilities available as normal. Be sure to bring some ground beans!
</I>&gt;<i> Should people want, I can restock the shop with club mate and other 
</I>&gt;<i> soft drinks also!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you plan to come in and play, shoot a message to the mailing list. 
</I>&gt;<i> I think we're all happy for you to bring friends/others to the space, 
</I>&gt;<i> and but remember that as this event is open to the public, the wearing 
</I>&gt;<i> of a face covering while &quot;not seated, eating or drinking&quot; is a legal 
</I>&gt;<i> requirement.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The worst case scenario is that I'm on my own at 57N BBQing food and 
</I>&gt;<i> drinking beer for an afternoon/evening while working on space 
</I>&gt;<i> infrastructure projects, it's not such a bad life.
