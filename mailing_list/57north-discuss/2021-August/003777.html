<PRE>Heya
That sounds like an ace idea, nice one :)  Count me in, will bring some BBQ
stuff, undersized BBQ and some inevitable veg/haloumi kebabs or something.
I've been meaning to crack open the screen printing kit again, so this
seems like a good excuse to knock out some lariy rainbow 57n t-shirts.
See you Sunday :)
Andy

&gt;<i> Hi All!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's been ages since we had a social event, so let's hang out and
</I>&gt;<i> celebrate Free Software projects!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A lot of Free Software projects have had major releases this year.
</I>&gt;<i> To name a few that members of the hacklab are excited by or involved in:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   * Debian[1] released version 11 just last week and I'm excited
</I>&gt;<i>   * FreeBSD[2] released version 13 in April, and tj is excited.
</I>&gt;<i>   * OpenBSD[3] had their 50th major release, 6.9, in May and irl is
</I>&gt;<i> excited.
</I>&gt;<i>   * Joomla[4] has released version 4 this week and Andyg is excited!
</I>&gt;<i>   * Fedora[5] release 34 in April and I'm sure someone is excited?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you are contributing to these projects, ! If I've missed the one that
</I>&gt;<i> you're excited by, I'm sorry, just reply and tell us!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let's gather at the space on Sunday, 22nd August at 3pm and talk about our
</I>&gt;<i> favorite free software projects and why they're cool. Presentations (in
</I>&gt;<i> ODP) in 3 part harmony are not mandatory!
</I>&gt;<i> I will probably try and BBQ some food at 5/6pm as a stand in for &quot;dinner&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> - you are welcome to do the same! This depends on the weather, which is
</I>&gt;<i> currently listed as &quot;overcast&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'll be bringing some beer, but there is also a great new coffee machine
</I>&gt;<i> (espresso and drip) that was gifted by Marcel and tea-making facilities
</I>&gt;<i> available as normal. Be sure to bring some ground beans!
</I>&gt;<i> Should people want, I can restock the shop with club mate and other soft
</I>&gt;<i> drinks also!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you plan to come in and play, shoot a message to the mailing list.
</I>&gt;<i> I think we're all happy for you to bring friends/others to the space, and
</I>&gt;<i> but remember that as this event is open to the public, the wearing of a
</I>&gt;<i> face covering while &quot;not seated, eating or drinking&quot; is a legal requirement.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The worst case scenario is that I'm on my own at 57N BBQing food and
</I>&gt;<i> drinking beer for an afternoon/evening while working on space
</I>&gt;<i> infrastructure projects, it's not such a bad life.
