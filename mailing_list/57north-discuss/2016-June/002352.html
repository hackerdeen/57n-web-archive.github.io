<PRE>&gt;<i> It seems a little like you and Hibby are having a competition to see 
</I>&gt;<i> who
</I>&gt;<i> can post this first.
</I>
Is that what this is? It would explain why I considered posting 
yesterday just to get people decent advance warning.

&gt;<i> I don't imagine I will be in, I really need to start putting things 
</I>&gt;<i> into
</I>&gt;<i> boxes. God it is so much work, why do I have all these things? Why 
</I>&gt;<i> don't
</I>&gt;<i> I live out of a small rucksack? I will probably be in.
</I>
I did all of my packing on the night of and the morning of the move.
I'm a disorganised mess.
Don't be like me. Throw everything out and live out of a small rucksack.
Just like the Japanese Minimalist guy [1]

Be like him.

...I'll be in, spewing off verbal diarrhoea and drinking Irn Bru. I 
might try to contact Ed on the radio again.
