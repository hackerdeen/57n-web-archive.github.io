<PRE>Hi All,

Can you do an art?

You may be interested in below. It's time to come up with the look and
feel for the next release of the Debian operating system.

Thanks,
Iain.

Hi,

This is the official call for proposals for the Stretch cycle. Please
look on the wiki[1].  At the same time, we would like to thank Juliette
Taka BELIN for doing the Lines theme for Jessie[2].

So, if you would like (or know someone who would like) to create a
desktop look and feel that will be seen by trillions[3] of people, be
sure to send in your artwork ASAP!

     Deadline for submissions: 5th of September 2016

The artwork is usually picked based on which theme looks the most:

  - &quot;Debian&quot;

     (I am not defining this since I think everyone has their own take
      of what Debian means to them)

  - plausible to integrate without patching core software

      (As much as we love some of the insanely hot looking themes, some
       would require heavy GTK+ theming and patching GDM/GNOME.)

  - clean / well designed

      (without becoming something that gets annoying to look at a
       year down the road.  Examples include Joy and Lines)

For more information / details, please post to the Debian Desktop[4]
list, I will set the reply-to, if others want to continue this thread
there.

Thanks,
~Niels

PS: Also a thanks to Paul Tagliamonte, who coordinated the artwork for
Jessie.
