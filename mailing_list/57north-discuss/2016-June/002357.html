Hi, Hibby.

I'll be in tonight with Giorgio Clivio, who is a Minecraft Youtuber!

Giorgio is the son of my friend Luca in Milan who I'm building the
servers for and he's doing work experience with Minke Informatics this
week. First task was to build a gaming spec. PC to run Minecraft :-)

Bye,

  Tony.
