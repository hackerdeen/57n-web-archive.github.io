<PRE>You should come to the space more! It's been discussed at least 3 times, along with the requirement to accompany guests.
Doc wanted to take it to the mailing list but we overpowered him and decided as a group that wasn't necessary. 

It's a shame it's running so close to the open night, but sometimes things slip a little!
