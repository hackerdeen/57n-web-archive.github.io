<PRE>Morning team!

Thanks Tom, that sounds pretty useful!

We managed to get the EngageSpace (working title) cleared out nicely last night - we've kept around 20 chairs to serve as chairs for workstations and other areas, and Doc, Ed &amp; I had a good long thing about furniture layout and areas. Those should hopefully be drawn up and sent to the list soon along with an email begging for hardware, time and probably money.

At 35a, we reckon we've managed to pack about 50% of the 'loose goods' and we've dismantled a standing desk. There's still lots to be done there, and it'd be great if we could get together and do more work there this weekend!
As I'm not around for most of it, I'll let others do the email to the list to define times and activities, but it will be putting things in boxes and unscrewing the remaining standing desk.
We also need to start moving our packed boxes to the EngageSpace.

It's our goal to be completely out of 35a by the end of May, and over the month of June work together to build out, paint, decorate and organise the new space! You can see the ideas, timelines and key areas we're working on the wiki here:
<A HREF="https://wiki.57north.org.uk/index.php/EngageSpace">https://wiki.57north.org.uk/index.php/EngageSpace</A>

It would be really helpful if we could get some more members on point to help run some of the moving related activities.
Currently we have:

Doc - plasterboard &amp; building fitout/furniture build / shelving build and space electrics
Ed - Clearout of 35a and Moving
Peter - doors &amp; access control
irl - lighting of EngageSpace
hibby - Networking

Doc could use some hands to help and some brains to work with on designing and fitting out the area, and we need all the bodies we can get to help move things and install things. It'd be great if someone could help catalogue our tools and organise them into our new space's tool storage area, and we also need a museum curator!

I will be doing network stuff when I return from the US (End of june), but if someone wants to do wiring and things, that would be very helpful and maybe get us up and running a little quicker. 

cheers,
hx
