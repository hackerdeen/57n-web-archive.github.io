<PRE>Woo!

I'll be down at the space probably begging for more money for the new space.

Also showing what I have spent so far, I am currently 1 Pound over budget.

</I>&gt;<i> You will have no doubt seen the email traffic regarding our move from
</I>&gt;<i> the old ThirdFloor location to lovely new digs below Engage gaming.
</I>&gt;<i> The new space is shaping up nicely [1] but there is still a bit of
</I>&gt;<i> finishing needed at the old location to make good.  The majority of
</I>&gt;<i> kit has been moved and the remaining kit that isn't staying is mostly
</I>&gt;<i> being stacked at the window end [2].
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We are hoping Tuesday hackers will be able to attend the ThirdFloor
</I>&gt;<i> address this eve to help us finish the remaining tasks. These include:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  - Final misc kit boxing and the wrapping of wood in tarp(s) for transport
</I>&gt;<i>  - Carrying boxes down the steps to the ground floor holding area
</I>&gt;<i>    at the foot of the stairs
</I>&gt;<i>  - Moving boxes from the ground floor into the parked van
</I>&gt;<i>  - Unpacking van at the new space (1 person to assist the driver)
</I>&gt;<i>  - Cleaning the old space surfaces
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> With the usual Tuesday attendance - we will be done in no time :)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> All member boxes will remain at the old space location until the 29th
</I>&gt;<i> May when they will collectively be transported over. There is a large
</I>&gt;<i> pile of kit that will be trashed next Tuesday so please check the
</I>&gt;<i> labelled pile for any items you would like keeping - there might be
</I>&gt;<i> some gems in there! If rescued kit is too big to fit in your box,
</I>&gt;<i> contact Nordin to arrange transport over. There is still desk space in
</I>&gt;<i> the old space and internet, should members need either this evening.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Lastly and somewhat unrelated, deciding to sign up to this list stood
