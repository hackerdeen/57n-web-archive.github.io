<PRE>Apols all - it was spur-of-moment thing from an IRC chat with no
obligations from others to pop along as Rob and I were enough to move
items. I just thought I'd share our plans.

We did it so we could make tomorrow possibly the first functional Tues in
the new space :), thats all.

The rack, member boxes and pretty much everything else is now moved over
but some discussion and work is needed to find homes for them. Only items
left at thirdfloor are cleaning sundries and trash items, which I'll trash
on Thurs if anyone is free to assist.

Cheers,
Ed
