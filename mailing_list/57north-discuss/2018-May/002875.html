Had there been more notice, could have helped with this. Me and Ana were
in the new space around 6pm installing some of the faceplates for the
data circuits.

For the old rack, we planned to put this upstairs and out of the way. A
new rack will go downstairs.

As for the stereo, I don't think anyone has so far expressed an opinion
on where this will go. If it requires power/data circuits, speak up. We
have not planned any specifically for the stereo.

Thanks,
Iain.
