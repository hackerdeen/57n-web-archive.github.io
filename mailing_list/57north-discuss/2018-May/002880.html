Yes, I would like to see us including more of the membership in planning the rest of the fit out - and actually doing the work. 

It's been a bit of a mad dash to get to minimum viable hackspace as soon as possible once we decided to leave old space by end of this month[0] but hopefully now we are almost at that point we can slow down a bit and take the time to discuss things and plan the work so others can help.

No, that list is open to anyone who wants to subscribe to it. Currently has 11 subscribers, only 4 of which are  directors - the other director can take this as another reminder that they should subscribe to that list :)

[0] Thanks to the small number of people who've been handling that. I've been MIA for most of the last month as work and stuff got in the way...
