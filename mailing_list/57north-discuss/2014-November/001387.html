<PRE>Hi,

This looks like it was a productive meeting. I have a few comments:

On Thu, Nov 13, 2014 at 12:18:45PM +0000, Tom Jones wrote:
&gt;<i>  - It is to be noted that ctte-private emails can be seen by server

s/by server admins/by anyone in a privileged network position on the path the
email takes, including but not limited to governments, criminals and server
admins/

If any director has a GPG key they want signed by me, talk to me and
I'll probably do it.

I've removed myself from the ctte-private list, and have no interest in
looking at the emails myself, but there are a number of people now with
access to garioch (root access) and this is probably something to be
addressed in the near future.

&gt;<i>  - Rob to investigate adding a door intercom to the street door
</I>
Remember that our landlord does not own that door, and Ed will be able to
tell you how opposed the actual building owner was to the idea. I'm not
saying don't do it, just you should be aware that it probably won't be easy.

&gt;<i>  e Website update (Open Tues, Directors)
</I>&gt;<i>    - Dave to place call to the membership to take on administration roles
</I>&gt;<i>    for social media
</I>
I am happy to provide support via email and in the space for anyone that
wishes to take over the website management.

&gt;<i>    - Hackhub v2 is currently awaiting proposals and a projects owner from
</I>&gt;<i>    the membership
</I>
As above.

Thanks,
Iain.
