<PRE>Apropos to nothing, I'm shifting a lot of boxes in my flat on the weekend
of the 15th/16th of this month.  Somewhere near the bottom of the pile is
a smallish RS box packed to the gunnels with random &quot;new components&quot;
mostly still in their RS baggies such as D-connectors, 555 timer PCBs,
resistors, capacitors etc.

Unless anyone objects strenuously, I was planning to donate this along
with a small set of anti-static drawers that are falling apart but full of
sorted, new resistors, to the Hackspace.  Just as long as they're not
going to immediately be thrown out.

During the same box-shuffle I hope to find that dummy video camera I
promised you too.

I'll either get my pal Aidan (a member) or my pal Dennis (not a member yet
but very interested) to drop them off.

Still waiting till you get ground floor premises.  When you do, I have a
huge box of unused but v. old rechargable batteries for you - NiCd, 1.2v
each, about the size of two &quot;D&quot; cells.  10 would power an electric
wheelchair or a killer robot - dealer's choice. :-)  There's just no way
anybody's going to carry it up those stairs, short of making about 20
trips with 2 batteries each time.

Peet
