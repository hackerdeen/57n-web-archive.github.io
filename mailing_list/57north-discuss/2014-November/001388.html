This was more meant to state the fact that in the clear emails aren't secure
ever. The ctte-private lists is the wrong place for secure comms.

Why would that be prescient?

</I>
Yeah, this needs tidied up. 

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  - Rob to investigate adding a door intercom to the street door

</I>&gt;<i> Remember that our landlord does not own that door, and Ed will be able to

</I>
We know that this will be a challenge going in, the strip club have added a
note asking users of the building to not lock the door before 2100 on certain
week days. Maybe they could help us petition the landlord to get a working
intercom setup. As far as I know they have the same landlord as Sheena, so are
closer to the source.

&gt;<i> &gt;  e Website update (Open Tues, Directors)
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    - Dave to place call to the membership to take on administration roles
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    for social media
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I am happy to provide support via email and in the space for anyone that
</I>&gt;<i> wishes to take over the website management.
</I>
Cool, I hope someone will step forward and take this on. If they do there are
probably others that will offer support.

&gt;<i> &gt;    - Hackhub v2 is currently awaiting proposals and a projects owner from
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;    the membership
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As above.
</I>
Ditto.
