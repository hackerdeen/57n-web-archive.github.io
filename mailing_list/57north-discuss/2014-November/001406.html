<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>At the last board meeting we briefly discussed how we should be handling
access to the space for members who have fallen behind in paying their
dues. It was decided to consult the rest of you on how you think we
should be handling this. 

In the past the logic on hackhub that allowed you to open the door was
that you had to have paid in the current month or the two previous
months. This approach is (arguably - feed me some beer and I'll happily
argue either side of the point) incompatible with our articles since
they grant access to the space to members and require the action of the
board to end/suspend membership so it shouldn't be an automated process.
Now all members are able to open the door until they are manually
dismembered in hackhub (which should only happen after the board has
resolved to dismember that person (or I (or another admin) screw(s)
up)).  

Are you happy that this manual process is OK (bearing in mind it took me
the better part of a month to get round to sending this email -
dismembering anyone requires coordinated action of the board (or those
willing to do some work to help the board (any volunteers?)) to send
reminders and have a meeting to actually pass the resolution so will
have a (considerable) delay from a member stopping paying)? Do you think
we should have some automated removal of access?

If someone falls behind what do you think they should be owe to get back
up to date? Full price for all the intervening months? This plus last
month (even if the gap to the last payment is larger)? How should we be
dealing with someone coming back after they've been dismembered? Follow
the normal new member procedure?
