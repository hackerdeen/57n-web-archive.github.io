</I>&gt;<i> Hi, Robert.

</I>&gt;<i> I think there are two quite different cases:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Member uses the space, but doesn't pay subs.
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Member doesn't use the space and doesn't pay subs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Case #1 automatic dismemberment prevents free-loaders using the space.
</I>&gt;<i> Case #2 automatic dismemberment helps maintain space security.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I favour automatic dismemberment according to clear rules. However,

</I>&gt;<i> that they owe retrospectively is a disincentive to continuing their

</I>&gt;<i> procedure to reinstate anyone who has been automatically dismembered.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Bye,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>   Tony.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I agree with Tonys points.

One point I would bring up, is some sort of notification to members that
have been dismembered. Being one of those.. I was looking for some sort of
communication to state this had occurred. But maybe that's just my personal
preference and may add to much manual effort to the task.
