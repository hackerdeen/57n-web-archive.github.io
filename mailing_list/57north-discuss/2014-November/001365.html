hi, I will be at the space this evening - looking forward to the
discussions :)


&gt;<i> This weeks Themed Thursday will be an evening looking at various things
</I>&gt;<i> to cause or sense movement.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We will have some motors, servos and steppers (at least one of each) and
</I>&gt;<i> example control systems to have a play with (and hopefully people who
</I>&gt;<i> understand them to have a chat with).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On the sensing side we have accelerometers and some ideas around making
</I>&gt;<i> potentiometers from conductive ink.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There was talk a while ago of building a communication system that pulls
</I>&gt;<i> on string for its physical layer. This talk might continue and perhaps
</I>&gt;<i> even get as far as some action.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Bring along anything you have to make or sense movement (anyone got a
</I>&gt;<i> collection of solenoids? Some hydraulic or pneumatic rams? Does anybody
</I>&gt;<i> know what they're doing with the mechanical side of things?
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkQ2pXkYjRM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkQ2pXkYjRM</A>), or movement related
</I>&gt;<i> problems or hair brained schemes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I won't be around next Thursday (13th). Any volunteers to run something?
</I>&gt;<i> The organising can be as simple as committing to being there and
</I>&gt;<i> announcing a topic you're interested in (or as complicated as you like).
