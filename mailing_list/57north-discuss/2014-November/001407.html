Hi, Robert.

I think there are two quite different cases:

1. Member uses the space, but doesn't pay subs.
2. Member doesn't use the space and doesn't pay subs.

Case #1 automatic dismemberment prevents free-loaders using the space.
Case #2 automatic dismemberment helps maintain space security.

I favour automatic dismemberment according to clear rules. However,
asking someone who hasn't actually been using the space to pay the subs.
that they owe retrospectively is a disincentive to continuing their
membership. I think it would be better to follow the new member
procedure to reinstate anyone who has been automatically dismembered.

Bye,

  Tony.
