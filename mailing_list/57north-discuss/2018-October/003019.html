<PRE>I finally fixed the address field in hub to be edittable. If you have
moved since signing up (and not already updated address by telling
someone with access to the DB to do it manually): plesase update that.

<A HREF="https://hub.57north.org.uk/hub/profile/edit">https://hub.57north.org.uk/hub/profile/edit</A>

We are supposed to have up to date address details for all members in
case we (or someone else) needs to send you a letter. So far the space
has only used email to contact members but this might not always be the
case, and there are circumstances where it might be someone else who has
to contact you and they might have other preferences.

Space Corp directive 26 says each member is responsible for telling the
board when their address changes. I would say that the mechanism for
doing that should now be to update your address yourself in hub, but I
am not on the board anymore so will let those that are chime in if they
have other preferences.

     Robert
