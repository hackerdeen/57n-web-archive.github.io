Hi, Doc.

That's me back from teaching Bio-Linux in Vienna last week...

I'm not one to quibble at a time of goodwill to *all* mankind, i.e.
including people of other genders, but that fact that God is dead
implies that he once actually existed and I don't believe that!

Maybe in a multiverse?

I'm now too exhausted from the major technical challenge involved in
putting up our outside Xmas lights to come into the Hackspace tonight.

I plan to spend the evening re-acquainting myself with a bottle of
Bushmills Irish Whiskey before embarking on a foray south tomorrow to
visit our families prior to the customary seasonal 'festivities' :-)

@doc - I don't send cards, I donate the money to 'Crisis' instead.

@Mike - Well pleased with my HP Pavilion x2 :-)

Bye,

  Tony.
