I will be making sporrans for stuffed unicorns this evening. Pretty sure
that counts as no practical use.

I'm planning to send out the hackspace christmas boxes some time within
the next week, so anything going into them needs to get to me (or the
space so I can pick it up from there) in that time frame - please let me
know if you've got anything, or any ideas. If anyone wants to help with
the costs that would be greatly appreciated. 

There is an AberLUG meeting tomorrow (19:30 @ Ma Cameron's) if anyone
can be tempted along for (vaguely) tech related discussion in a pub.

Apparently, three out of four people make up 75% of the population.
