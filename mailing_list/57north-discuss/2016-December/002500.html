<PRE>More Xen vuln(s). So garioch and finzean will be rebooting in the early
hours of  12th and 13th respectively.

We've been through this enough recently that I'm fairly confident
they'll come back up properly but as usual if you notice anything broken
say here (or tell me some other way).

Subject: Your BitFolk VPSes (&quot;garioch&quot;, &quot;finzean&quot;) need to be rebooted
for critical maintenance
Date: Sun, 04 Dec 2016 04:21:01 +0000

Dear customer,

We've recently been made aware of a critical security issue in the
hypervisor software (Xen) which we use to provide your service. Fixing
this problem will require us to reboot our hosts and therefore all
customer VPSes must also be rebooted (or experience suspend/restore -
see below).

We must apply this fix to ensure the security and reliability both of
your VPSes and of our infrastructure, which is why we have no choice but
to proceed with this work in the short period of time between
notification and the end of the embargo.

I understand that this will prove disruptive to you and that you would
prefer much more notice. In better circumstances we do provide more
notice and allow for deferrals or moving VPSes between hosts, but the
seriousness of these problems mean that we need to reboot everything
before the embargo on the details of the issue ends (12:00Z 13
December 2016).

Your VPSes have been assigned a maintenance window during which the
reboots will take place. The start of the maintenance window for each of
your VPSes is listed below, in UTC time zone. Each maintenance window is
up to 90 minutes long, though the work should be completed much sooner
than this, typically within a few minutes (yay, SSDs!).

+-----------------+---------------+--------------------+
|<i> Name            | Main IPv4     | Window start (UTC) |
</I>+-----------------+---------------+--------------------+
|<i>         garioch | 85.119.84.59  | 2016-12-12 02:00   |
</I>|<i>         finzean | 85.119.82.172 | 2016-12-13 00:30   |
</I>+-----------------+---------------+--------------------+

At some point in each maintenance window your VPS will be cleanly shut
down. The host it is on will then be patched and rebooted, and then your
VPS will be brought up again.

You should ensure that your VPS and all its services start up correctly
on boot. We offer a free Nagios monitoring service which can help you to
know if your VPS and its services are working correctly. If you have not
done so already then you may want to get in touch with us to have this
set up. You can do that by replying to this email and describing which
services you would like monitored.

If you would prefer for us to attempt to suspend and restore your VPS
to/from storage, resulting less disruption, then you can indicate that
preference on our web panel at:

    <A HREF="https://panel.bitfolk.com/account/config/#prefs">https://panel.bitfolk.com/account/config/#prefs</A>

Doing so will cause us to add Nagios ping checks for your VPS so we can
have a good chance at knowing if the restore was successful.

If you have any questions please reply to this email, which will open a
support ticket. Please note however that we cannot change the date or
time of the planned maintenance. There is no need to reply to this email
unless you have further questions, or wish to request Nagios monitoring.

Best regards,
Andy Smith
BitFolk Ltd
