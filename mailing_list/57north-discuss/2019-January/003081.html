<PRE>The other owner of the laser cutter thought we could just download the
software and use the dongle that we have.

On a very quick search I didn't find it, but I did find,
<A HREF="https://www.scorchworks.com/K40whisperer/k40whisperer.html">https://www.scorchworks.com/K40whisperer/k40whisperer.html</A> , which might be
an alternative.

&gt;<i> We now have a laser cutter on loan to the space from Peter (and its other
</I>&gt;<i> owner(s)).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For getting it running there are a few things we need to look at.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Have a play at moving the head *
</I>&gt;<i> Could work on getting control of the head without switching on the laser -
</I>&gt;<i> so could be independent of the other &quot;required&quot; tasks before the laser can
</I>&gt;<i> be switched on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There was a CD with software (Corel laser?) with it originally but I
</I>&gt;<i> don't  think that is still with it. We do have the USB dongle required to
</I>&gt;<i> make it work. Anyone able to find the software? And have a windows machine
</I>&gt;<i> that it will run on?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As for alternative software: I think the existing board speaks g-code of
</I>&gt;<i> some description. Could have a go at getting it working with some open
</I>&gt;<i> source tool chain?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Ventilation *
</I>&gt;<i> Need to hook up fan to extract fumes and vent them out of the space.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Could probably do with adding some filtration to capture some of the
</I>&gt;<i> noxious/carcinogous fumes rather than just venting them into the street.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Cooling *
</I>&gt;<i> For short tests just filling the bath and hooking up the pump will be
</I>&gt;<i> enough.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd be a lot happier if we added some cooling of the water in the
</I>&gt;<i> reservoir and temp monitoring of the water coming out of the laser tube to
</I>&gt;<i> make sure it doesn't get too high.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * fire extinguishers *
</I>&gt;<i> The space currently has 1 x 2kg CO2 extinguisher and 1 x 1kg powder
</I>&gt;<i> extinguisher (I think...).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I think the CO2 one is fine for putting next to the laser cutter in case
</I>&gt;<i> the fire inside it gets a bit too much, and might be at risk of getting
</I>&gt;<i> outside it. But it has been sitting for a few years now (a quick search
</I>&gt;<i> through my email suggests we're coming up on 5 years) so we might want to
</I>&gt;<i> get a fresh one? Or get it checked?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * E-stop *
</I>&gt;<i> Do we want an e-stop button in the power line to kill the laser in a hurry
</I>&gt;<i> if it get's out of control? I'm inclined towards yes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Interlocks *
</I>&gt;<i> Do we want to add interlock to keep the laser off when the case is open?
</I>&gt;<i> I'm mostly of the opinion that people not being idiots should be
</I>&gt;<i> sufficient, but I'm not sure how much we can rely on people not being
</I>&gt;<i> idiots...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * New mirrors *
</I>&gt;<i> Existing mirrors are reportedly a bit dirty.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We probably don't want to change them until after we've done a bit of
</I>&gt;<i> playing to make sure we know what we're doing with it while it is in
</I>&gt;<i> alignment.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Consumables *
</I>&gt;<i> Some bits of the laser cutter will wear out and need replaced eventually;
</I>&gt;<i> notably the tube, lens and mirrors, honeycomb for the bed, filters (if we
</I>&gt;<i> add any), fire extinguisher, and probably some other stuff I'm forgetting.
</I>&gt;<i> How do we want to cover that cost?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Need to think about both being able to cover the cost of replacement when
</I>&gt;<i> they wear out and what we need to do for if/when the owners want the laser
</I>&gt;<i> back. For the latter case the &quot;easy to account for&quot; way would be to get a
</I>&gt;<i> full set of new consumables now and then the existing ones can go back in
</I>&gt;<i> if/when the laser is going away, but that would need a decent amount of
</I>&gt;<i> money now: tube is about Â£100 on eBay [1].
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For consumables it is probably worth considering Smoke and Mirrors (
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://smokeandmirrors.store/">https://smokeandmirrors.store/</A>). They're a bit more expensive than eBay
</I>&gt;<i> options but possibly/probably more reliably decent quality parts.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Replacement control board *
</I>&gt;<i> There are a few drop in replacement control boards that would give a
</I>&gt;<i> complete open source tool chain for us to mess with.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've done a bit of looking around for them and am leaning towards a Pro
</I>&gt;<i> pack super gerbil: <A HREF="https://awesome.tech/buy-gerbil/">https://awesome.tech/buy-gerbil/</A> Anyone else have
</I>&gt;<i> other preferences? Or think we can live with the existing board?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * Other *
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What have I forgotten?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     Robert
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> [1] Though for about the same money (and a little bit of work with a
</I>&gt;<i> hacksaw to make a hole in the case for it to stick out of) we could go up
</I>&gt;<i> to a 60W (or more?) tube :D
