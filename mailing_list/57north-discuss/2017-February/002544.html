<PRE>I wasn't planning going as too busy this week with something on every school night but I got another PID Controller in the post today, so I guess I'll need to mount it in a box and hook it up. 
I've only got a polystyrene box ATT.  Safe as banks. What can go wrong.
I'll be shopping on ebay, gumtree, Amazon, Freegle etc for enclosures, IEC inlets, fuseholders, indicator lamps, TC sockets.
S/S wire racking (s/h), T5 luminaires, a polytunnel.
Damn this tomato habit.

I had a caffeinated coffee last night and was stressing until the wee hours about seeds, so I'm tired and tetchy as flip but it could lead to me S'gTFU and doing something for a change .

Talking of snacks the Tuck shop could use a restock if anyone is able to access a snackbar supplier for sweeties.
I got a box of crisps which I'll endeavour to take in

Subject: [57north-announce] Open Tuesday @ 57North, 2017-02-21

Today is open Tuesday at 57N and all are invited to come along after
7pm!

For those of you not in the know, Tuesday evenings are open to anyone
who wishes to come to 57North, Aberdeen's hackerspace! We get up to a
range of activities on Tuesday nights, including but not limited to
social contact, programming, manufacturing weird things and consuming
sugary treats. 
We usually begin at about 7, but sometimes someone will be in earlier. 
If you're unsure, ask in IRC!

If you're new, I'd suggest you bring a laptop, and perhaps a project you
want to work on.

If you're coming in, feel free to reply and tell us all what you're
planning to do.

I'll be doing a little bit of Debian after hopefully riding my mostly 
self-serviced and repaired bike in. 

Hooray!

Hx
