<PRE>I am in lands foreign so I shall not be joining all y'all. I've spent
all day playing with radios, servers, CCTV, audio systems and swearing
at people.
Much like every other day.

I have also checked that my house is occupied before making this public
declaration of absence, so you're not getting to half-inch any of my
toys - my flatmate is in residence. 

Cheers
