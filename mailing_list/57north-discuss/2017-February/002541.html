I will be in the space! 

I have plans to keep poking at a wifi driver, progress on that will
depend how paniced I am about work and probably the person density in
the space. 

I am going to play with rumble[1], a distributed p2p something app. We
tried playing with it at congress, but the spectrum was too intense for
it.

You should install it now if you fancy joining in.

Some people showed interest in the space at techmeetup last week,
hopefully they will be by. If people you don't know show up at the space
you should be extra welcoming, friendly and enthusiastic!
