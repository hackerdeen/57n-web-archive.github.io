<PRE>Sup!

I will be in to work on stuff (either a dumb markdown parser or a dumb LED
clock) and buying chocolate again. I am always open to helping others with
their projects too, so feel free to ask if you need help with anything.
I'll probably also be at TechMeetup tomorrow.

See most of you tonight...!

</I>&gt;<i> If you're coming in, feel free to reply and tell us all what you're
</I>&gt;<i> planning to do.

</I>&gt;<i> I'm going to look at the Weather station we got from our friends on the
</I>&gt;<i> continent and see what I need to buy to make it a complete unit. Once
</I>&gt;<i> it's
</I>&gt;<i> done I'll need to find somewhere sensible to site it!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> After I'm doing being a consumer, I'll talk loudly and continue trying
</I>&gt;<i> to work
</I>&gt;<i> out QT designer / QT Creator, QT5, PYQT and seeing if I can remember

</I>&gt;<i> Hooray!
