<PRE>I'll be in this afternoon also.

FYI the 3D printer bed is down. Its in need of a new adhesive plastic sheet
top - which is on order. I have stripped the old melty one off and cleaned
the plate glass ready for the new one, due tomorrow.

It melted after the bed was set too high (maybe?) over a small, high-detail
print. The sheet top may or may not have needed replacement, but going on
the idea it would make printing tricky in the medium term until general
wear smoothed it, and it was available via prime, I just grabbed it.

Cheers,
Ed
