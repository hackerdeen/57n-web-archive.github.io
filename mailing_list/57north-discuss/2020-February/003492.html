I massively underestimated how long it would take to mark and cut notches for half lap joints in this. I got 22 notches cut before I ran out of daylight. There are another 58 left to cut that I've marked up and then another 16 that will be marked up and cut once the rest of the structure is in place so they can be sized to fit. 

I think it'll probably be next weekend before I get back to finish this off - it's a lot easier in daylight and want to stay outside office hours to save annoying the neighbours which means weekend at this time of year.
