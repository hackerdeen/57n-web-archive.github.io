<PRE>I have built some more shelves for the space (or for my flat if you all decide the space doesn't want them). 

<A HREF="https://photos.app.goo.gl/qSojKEkoyehi4LVg9">https://photos.app.goo.gl/qSojKEkoyehi4LVg9</A>

The 2 sets of shelves used 1 sheet* of 12mm MDF and 9 2.4m 2x3s**. If making more I think I'd switch to 18mm MDF (or plywood). That would be £47.14 for materials*** - excluding the pieces for the angled braces, they're stuff that was in the wood pile, might need to include them if we're making lots more and run out of them. That's £22.48 for sheet of 18mm MDF and £2.74 each for the 2x3s.     

If we want these to handle heavier stuff can easily reinforce them.  

I'd propose making more shelves in this style as they're cheap, easy to make and can make them with whatever dimensions we like. The two sets I made today are different sizes to illustrate that flexibility and not at all because I miscounted how many 2x3s were needed and decided to shrink one set to what I had rather than go and get more.

* Well, equivalent of one sheet, was actually 4 quarter sheets as I had 2 quarters already and getting another 2 was easier to handle than getting a whole sheet and then cutting it down.

** Or what I'm calling 2x3s; they're 38mm x 63mm. Not sure if that's actually a 2x3 or not cause 2x3s aren't 2&quot;x3&quot; and I'm too lazy to go looking for the actual dimensions. 

*** I'm including pricing info for if we want to make more, I'm not looking to be reimbursed for these ones.
