No. Total for all the way across would be more like £375 - but I haven't figured out an actual plan for the other side, I'm thinking to not put shelves in all of it which would reduce the materials required, but then need to figure out what's needed for whatever we put in instead of shelves (if anything). So that is a very vague estimate. 

The £125 would fill in one of the gaps between a pillar and the wall. There are two more of those gaps. They're not all the same size and the  biggest gap is the middle one, but we would need to leave a gap to come and go through in that one, so end up wanting about 15m to go all the way across. The £125 does about 5.5m of that.

What do you consider to be your median achievement?
