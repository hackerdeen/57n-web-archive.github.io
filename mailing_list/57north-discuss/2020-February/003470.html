&gt;<i> So total of £113.90 for this section - probably ~£125 to give some money to cover screws and glue. I'm thinking make this section first and we can then decide if the same approach is what we want for the other bits or if we want to do something different.
</I>
£125 for a wall + shelving sounds like a good, cost-effective
solution. I'd be for it.

&gt;<i> Would want to cover about twice that distance for the other side coming across from the windows so ball park would be twice as much for that section. But I'm thinking that would be more shelves than we actually need so should probably do some other stuff with some of the bays on the other side (wood (or other long thin stuff) rack, some hooks for hanging stuff, any other ideas?)
</I>
Yea empty bays to stow/stack heavy crated items, and bays with 'arms'
to lean long items like wood across might be useful here. It would
need a more solid back then just fabric tho. Perhaps additional
horizontal slats just to stop items from leaning out our area. Also
maybe a foot so the weight of the items stowed adds to the stability.

&gt;<i> I'm away this weekend so was planning to build this the following weekend (22nd and 23rd) if the rest of you think this is a good plan and directors approve of the spending. Some help then would be appreciated (or if anyone wants to get going before then: even better).
</I>
I am here and free to assist that weekend. Would we do all the cutting
in the space on a tarp or something? Firstly we should ping Isobel to
see if she has any further update on the new lease - last I heard
there was still high confidence but good to check before we invest in
infrastructure.

Nordin.
