&gt;<i> I'm thinking to make ladder style uprights like the ones on the

</I>&gt;<i> It'll work fine for putting boxes on (so long as the bottom of the box

</I>&gt;<i> sheet material on bits of it if we want actual shelves for anything
</I>&gt;<i> that needs it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> For height: I'm thinking to just use full 2.4m 2x3s for the uprights
</I>&gt;<i> which will give about a 6cm gap  to the ceiling above them. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> To go from the pillar to the east wall (where it bumps into the room
</I>&gt;<i> around the stairwell/cupboards/kitchen bit) would work with 5 uprights
</I>&gt;<i> giving 3 1.2ish² m bays and one 2.4ish m bay. This'll take 35 2x3s for
</I>&gt;<i> a total of £95.90. That's with 4 shelves per bay, about the same pitch
</I>&gt;<i> as the tall set from the last ones I made, would be another 1.5 2x3s
</I>&gt;<i> per shelf per 1.2m bay to have more shelves.  
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm thinking to put fabric on the outside (of the hackspace) side of
</I>&gt;<i> the shelf wall to give a clean look to the rest of the room (rather
</I>&gt;<i> than the collection of junk look of seeing into the hackspace bit of
</I>&gt;<i> the room). I think the cheapest way to get enough fabric to cover that
</I>&gt;<i> is 2 super king size sheets. ASDA has them for £9 each³ with a choice
</I>&gt;<i> of grey, white, cream or pink.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So total of £113.90 for this section - probably ~£125 to give some
</I>&gt;<i> money to cover screws and glue. I'm thinking make this section first
</I>&gt;<i> and we can then decide if the same approach is what we want for the
</I>&gt;<i> other bits or if we want to do something different. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Would want to cover about twice that distance for the other side
</I>&gt;<i> coming across from the windows so ball park would be twice as much for
</I>&gt;<i> that section. But I'm thinking that would be more shelves than we
</I>&gt;<i> actually need so should probably do some other stuff with some of the
</I>&gt;<i> bays on the other side (wood (or other long thin stuff) rack, some
</I>&gt;<i> hooks for hanging stuff, any other ideas?) 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm away this weekend so was planning to build this the following
</I>&gt;<i> weekend (22nd and 23rd) if the rest of you think this is a good plan
</I>&gt;<i> and directors approve of the spending. Some help then would be
</I>&gt;<i> appreciated (or if anyone wants to get going before then: even
</I>&gt;<i> better). 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Robert
</I>&gt;<i>

(this was intentionally two emails, I swear)

I like this idea, but I guess I did suggest bits of it so I would. I
think the space both should and will pay for it, I am not sure if the
space has the funds or if we will have to ask for an injection from the
members. 

50/50 would be a nice way to do this where the space pays and the
membership help. It helps us keep money around for panics in the future.
