I've got a bunch of UV 12V LED tape. Same stuff the clock in the space is made from. It's not very UV (a decent chunk of the output is actually visible) but does make UV reactive stuff fluoresce if close enough or sufficiently brighter than ambient.

I can't find any in the space at the moment (other than the bits in the clock, which would be quite inconvenient as a portable light) but I've definitely got a few 5m rolls at home and can drop some off at the space if you want to try it.
