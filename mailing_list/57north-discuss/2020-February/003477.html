Thanks for the clafification.

The mountain of crap from the mens shed hides a lot of the space we need
to cover. I am told that they will start moving this (or next week), but
they are also going to paint once then move has started (who knows why).

Once they have moved it will be clearer how much space we need to cover.

Shelves across the entire room is certainly overkill, but I think a
first section of shelves is a great idea.
