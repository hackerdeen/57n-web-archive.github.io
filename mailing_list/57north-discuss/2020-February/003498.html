I was in this evening and have mostly¹ assembled the ladder pieces. 

I'm planning to be in tomorrow from about lunch time to get the rest of the cutting done and will then be on to the 3D assembling step. It would be useful to have a second person to hold things in place as they are assembled, or looking around to see where they aren't fitting and need shaved down etc. I'm fairly sure I can do it by myself so no need for anyone to go out of their way to come help, but if anyone has nothing better to do it should go faster with some help. 

I think I should be ready for the assembly step by 15:00. I'll also happily accept help cutting stuff before then, and/or can hang off doing the assembly if someone can be along later.

¹ I split two of the cross pieces so will need to cut replacements for them tomorrow.
