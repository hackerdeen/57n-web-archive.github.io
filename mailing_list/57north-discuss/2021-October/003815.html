<PRE>Hello Wouter

I think Lawrence is right.

5 lamps with 12v LED's will each run about .2A and if you have 5 for 8 hours that should be an 8Ah batteryjust use the same wiring for the bulb but make up some bulbs with LED's in them instead.

It'll save on the size of battery you need, there are at least two 7Ah in the space if you want.

The inverter will be lossy so you would be better without it.

</I>&gt;<i> My experience is narrow boats and you would then use low voltage lamps running direct off 12V. Plenty of LEDs that will do that now a days.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Using and carrying a lead acid battery, key part ACID. You will need to box it and protect it.. Bigger risk is dropping something metal across the
</I>&gt;<i> terminals.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Capacity:
</I>&gt;<i> For boating you reckon on no more than 50% drain from the battery, without affecting the life of the battery. So draining 2Amps for 10 hours takes
</I>&gt;<i> you close to that. Also for that sort of load would be using a leisure battery and not a starter battery. Leisure battery designed for delivering
</I>&gt;<i> small amounts of power over longer term. Narrow boats like motorhomes tend to be fitted with multiple batteries, a starter battery for the engine and
</I>&gt;<i> one or more leisure batteries for the domestic side. e.g. [1]<A HREF="https://www.eurocarparts.com/p/lion-leisure-battery-676-65ah-444776761.">https://www.eurocarparts.com/p/lion-leisure-battery-676-65ah-444776761.</A> USed to use 4
</I>&gt;<i> 110Ah Lesiure batteries for domestics.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Invertors: What is the efficiency of the invertor? At that low a load on it I could imagine it drawing 3Amps to deliver 20W, down circa 60-70%. Its
</I>&gt;<i> real consumer grade electronics, built to a price not performance.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>     Hey all,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Next month I hope to attend the first outdoor Christmas fair with my lamps, with a gazebo stand at Christmas market in Ballater. Unfortunately
</I>&gt;<i>     the fair does not have the possibility to have fun electricity to my stand, so I will need to source my own solutions.  Since it is my first
</I>&gt;<i>     outdoor fair, I don't have a practical setup yet.  So I thought to pass my ideas via this mailing list for second (and third, etc) opinions.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     What are my needs:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     1)  3 to 5 lamps on the table:  Total 20-25 Watt consumption in total
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     2) Approx 8 hours electricity
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Solution:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     1) 40 Ah lead battery 12V:  If my calculations are correct, 25 Watt at 12V would give me 2.08Ah, so a 40Ah battery should be sufficient  .
</I>&gt;<i>     Something like this one :[2]<A HREF="https://www.eurocarparts.com/p/lion-063-car-battery-3-year-guarantee-444770631">https://www.eurocarparts.com/p/lion-063-car-battery-3-year-guarantee-444770631</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     2) Use inverter to convert 12V DC to 230V AC  [3]<A HREF="https://www.ringautomotive.com/en/product/RINVU300">https://www.ringautomotive.com/en/product/RINVU300</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     3) recharge the battery at home afterwards through an indoor charger.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Safety concern
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     This solution looks fairly simple, but is it really save to use this setup in outdoor environment?  Are the crocodile clips that come with the
</I>&gt;<i>     inverter safe to use for hours? What other safety precautions should I take, to avoid accidents? And lastly, how does moisture affect the the
</I>&gt;<i>     performance of such a battery?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Looking forward to hearing your inputs on this.  Would this setup with a lead battery work, or should I consider a higher density (but costlier)
</I>&gt;<i>     battery.  I got 2 USB powerbanks lingering about (Total 20Ah), but no inverter from 5V DC to 230V AC (via USB ?)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     Cheerio,
</I>&gt;<i>
