Hi Rob,

I'm in the space now and having a wee look, things inline.

</I>&gt;<i> I'm thinking zoom on projector⁰ with a few seats arranged pointed at that. Plus couple of cameras to feed into zoom: one wide covering audience and tighter one with mic¹ for speaker (don't know if main speaker will be remote or actually there yet but this'll cover folks asking questions if not needed for main speaker). Plus something to make noise from zoom.  
</I>
The Optoma EX530 is here. We have a webcam attached to the media
workstation that can be used, and a shure C606 into the 2 channel
behringer desk attached to the same workstation. I can bring another
webcam in, at the very least. 

&gt;<i> If I have time before then I might set up OBS for camera switching/mixing, if not² will just join the meeting twice and zoom handle the switching. 
</I>
&quot;Media workstation&quot; has OBS, but not very configured.

&gt;<i> I am thinking to shuffle furniture around a bit to have somewhere to put projector and seats pointed at same wall it is. Or if I can find my pop up screen might use that at one end of existing table layout and not need to move anything. If do want to rearrange things I can shift them (and put them back) on the evening. 
</I>
We're lacking any large areas of wall to point a projector at. There's a ~40&quot;
screen by the sofas that might be a good starter?

&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i> Robert
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ⁰ Is my old projector still in the space? Does it still work? I've got another one I can take in if not. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ¹ Are there any mics in the space? All of mine that I know where they are are attached to headsets, though I should have a couple that would work for this. If I can figure out where me-of-a-couple-of-years-ago put them. That bastard has hidden so much of my stuff.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ² &quot;Not&quot; is currently looking more likely but there is always a chance that stuff on my TODO list will take less time than I expect and I might develop some free time...
</I></PRE>
