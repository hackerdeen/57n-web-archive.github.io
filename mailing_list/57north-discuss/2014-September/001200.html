<PRE>You know what? I&#8217;ll stand as a candidate for election as director, too.

Sure, I&#8217;m a newer member, but I care for the Hackerspace. I have some not terribly radical and potentially feasible ideas for dealing with financial issues (note: they&#8217;re probably not going to help, don&#8217;t elect me on that alone), and I seriously care about diversity (how could I not, I am very diverse). I like hackers, and I also like space, so I like hackerspaces even more. Space, space, space, wanna go to space.

I&#8217;m probably not the best choice, but I am a *choice*, and that is clearly what counts. Saying that, I am obviously humble, and saying I&#8217;m humble means I&#8217;m obviously not, as the mark of humility is never claiming you have it.
