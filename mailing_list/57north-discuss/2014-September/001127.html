I think it went really well and we should keep doing it, though it was
partially my fault.

&gt;<i> I'm not looking for feedback on my (obviously perfect) speaking

I thought your talking skills were awesome, I can only imagine you have been
talking for a number of years. :P

&gt;<i> If it's a good idea to run with, who's volunteering for next week? I'd
</I>&gt;<i> really like to see a manifesto for a project laid out, a progress report
</I>&gt;<i> on what you're doing, or maybe just a review of what you keep in your

</I>
Give me a couple of weeks to sort my life out and I will volunteer. I really
like the idea of having a concentrated update on what folks in the space are
doing.

&gt;<i> It doesn't need to be anything flashy, it doesn't need to have slides,
</I>&gt;<i> it doesn't need to be long - It just has to show us what you're excited
</I>&gt;<i> about and what you're doing!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you think it's a bad idea, I'd like to hear about any suggestions
</I>&gt;<i> you've got for changes to the format of Open Tuesday to make it more
</I>&gt;<i> open to new members and effective as a way of demonstrating and
</I>&gt;<i> advertising our culture to them.
</I>
I think we did drop the ball on the recording last night. I can't imagine the
recordings are going to get a ton of attention, but it seems like a good
resource for others thinking about speaking at a Tuesday.

&gt;<i> Of course, I'd also like to hear if you think Tuesday's perfect just the
</I>&gt;<i> way it is as a place to get together, be social and hack at some stuff!
