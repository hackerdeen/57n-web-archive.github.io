<PRE>hey all!

For those of you who were there last night - I'd like some feedback on
how you felt having a talk in the middle of the evening went?

I'm not looking for feedback on my (obviously perfect) speaking
technique and/or thoughts on EMF, but how having someone speak during
the evening felt and if it'd be a good thing to have. (if you want to
privately email me, I'm willing to listen!)

If it's a good idea to run with, who's volunteering for next week? I'd
really like to see a manifesto for a project laid out, a progress report
on what you're doing, or maybe just a review of what you keep in your
toolkit, bits box. If anyone else has any good ideas, feel free to
contribute them! 

It doesn't need to be anything flashy, it doesn't need to have slides,
it doesn't need to be long - It just has to show us what you're excited
about and what you're doing!

If you think it's a bad idea, I'd like to hear about any suggestions
you've got for changes to the format of Open Tuesday to make it more
open to new members and effective as a way of demonstrating and
advertising our culture to them.

Of course, I'd also like to hear if you think Tuesday's perfect just the
way it is as a place to get together, be social and hack at some stuff!

Hx
