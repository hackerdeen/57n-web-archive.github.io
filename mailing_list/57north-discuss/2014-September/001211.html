<PRE>Hi,

I came in today around 2:30pm and there was a homeless guy just sleeping in
the hall. This isn't the first time we've found this guy there, although
last time it was late at night. If you happen upon him, I suggest just
calling the police. He's had his chances.

This wasn't a matter of the front door being unlocked. hibby has confirmed
that he and adventureloop did indeed lock the front door when they left last
night.

It is perhaps time to revisit the idea of a camera in the hallway. I know
there was discussion about this before that went in circles, but the
solution I propose is primarily to act as a deterrent to the homeless guy
but also provides us some help if we're broken into again. Just recording to
tape/hdd the last 48 hours.

Any other ideas are welcome, as well as ideas on how we would go about
implementing this.

Iain.
