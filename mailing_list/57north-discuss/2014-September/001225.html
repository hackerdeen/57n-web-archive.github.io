Based on conversations I have had between the landlady, the handyman
and the business tenant below us, there is a strong chance this would be
approved as long as the system was robust.

I think sign-posting homeless people to the support services that exist
(e.g. a poster on the door/wall) is worth pursing on conjunction with other
things.  However even ignoring the hazardous litter, liquids and fag butts
we occasionally find as we leave/arrive (cannot be sure who is leaving
this), I find the fact that an unauthorised person could have access to the
entire building possibly overnight, quite unsettling.  A Pi installed with
zoneminder w/ webcam + ethernet backup is an easy(ish) starter solution. If
the linux build is done right, it can do the job at next to no cost
depending on how it's powered.

Cheers,
Ed
