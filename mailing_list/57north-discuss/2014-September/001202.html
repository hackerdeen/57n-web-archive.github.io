<PRE>Hi,

The following is potentially of interest.

If you are interested, I would guess contact Laura Meikle
&lt;<A HREF="http://lists.57north.co/listinfo/57north-discuss">laura at lambdajam.org</A>&gt;.

Iain.

Subject: Engineer Helpers for the First Lego League

Hi Frank,

I hope you're doing well and enjoying the start of a new academic year.

Teams taking part in the First Lego League have now started building their
lego missions and designing their robots. We still have 3 teams in Aberdeen
who would love the help of an engineer this season. Now that term has
started, I'd be very appreciative if you could ask around your students and
colleagues to see if anyone would be able to help the following schools?

- Robert Gordon's College, AB10 1FE (meet Monday 1.30pm until 2pm)
- Charleston School, AB12 3FH (meeting days and times to be confirmed)
- Harlaw Academy, AB10 1RG (meeting days and times to be confirmed)

We're asking that engineer mentors visit the teams at least 3 times. To be a
mentor all you need is enthusiasm and a desire to inspire the next
generation. Not only will you get to play with Lego but you will also obtain
a Young Academy of Scotland accreditation.

I've attached a flyer with more information.

If the time commitment is an issue then we're also looking for judges and
volunteers to help out at the tournament on Wednesday 10th December. It will
be held at the Satrosphere Science Centre from 9.30am until 3pm. It's always
a fun day where the teams come to celebrate all they have achieved that
season.

All the best,

Laura
