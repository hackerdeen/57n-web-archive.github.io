<PRE>Hello Hackers,

Dr. Bruce Scharlau one of the organisers of Northern Lights Conf (and is on
this list) has invited 57 North to speak at NL. This is a massive honour from
the guys running NL and a opportunity to speak at a general tech event.

I ran a straw poll among the members I have seen in the last week and Hibby has
volunteered to speak. He would probably appreciate your helpful thoughts and
ideas.

I have included the original email received from Bruce in the spirit of
openness and to let everyone have the same starting point as Hibby.

----- Forwarded message from &quot;Scharlau, Dr Bruce A.&quot; &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.57north.co/listinfo/57north-discuss">b.scharlau at abdn.ac.uk</A>&gt; -----

Guys,

I know I mentioned this in passing to Tom, but wanted to make it more
'official' as it were. We have set 17th October as the day for Northern Lights
this year and the theme is 'context'. <A HREF="http://northernlightsconf.co.uk/">http://northernlightsconf.co.uk/</A>

It would be good if someone from 57 North could do something along the theme
about the boundaries of tech/digital/hardware/software/etc as you see it
fitting the theme. But this is just a suggestion. It's teh way you blend these
issues together into whole of 57 North that appeals. So let me know if you're
interested and give me an idea of what you'd want to talk about with respect to
'context'.

----- End forwarded message -----
