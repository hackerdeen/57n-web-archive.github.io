Raising funds for the space is a noble cause, but I think it could limit it to
stuff people don't want or don't see any value in. The radio club has a
monthly 'junk sale' it is a mixture of equipment donated to the club(sadly it
seems to be when members die) and equipment that members want to sell. 

I think we should allow people to either donate to the space for sale(the space
gets the proceeds) or sell there own stuff(they keep the proceeds). Maybe we
encourage a donation for having the chance to sell stuff.

&gt;<i> Suitable items might include:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  * Tools or materials
</I>&gt;<i>  * Useful / interesting / collectable hardware
</I>&gt;<i>  * Project 'leftovers'
</I>&gt;<i>  * Games, DVDs, books
</I>&gt;<i>  * Mobile phones
</I>&gt;<i>  * Camera equipment
</I>&gt;<i>  * Corporate gifts
</I>&gt;<i>  * Conference freebies
</I>&gt;<i>  * Drunken ebay / kickstarter purchases
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The only rule would be that if something doesn't sell, you have to take it
</I>&gt;<i> home with you again (rule 4: no dumping), or donate it to the 'vortex of
</I>&gt;<i> doom' if it's small enough.
</I>
We could do with an effort to throw away a load of crap.

&gt;<i> Why not have a rake through your pile of techno kipple (don't deny it - you
</I>&gt;<i> have one) this weekend to see if you have something you would be happy to
</I>&gt;<i> donate?
</I>
I moved boxes on Tuesday and found a load of goodies, it might be worth looking
it the space too.
