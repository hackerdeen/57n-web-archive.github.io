<PRE>Apropos to nothing, you just remionded me that I have a box lying somewhere with some yellow EL wire and three or four blue EL tubes, from when I &quot;pimped&quot; a case about a decade ago.  If I come across it I'll drop it off.  Hopefully by the time I find it you'll have a ground floor presence...

That sounds good, how are you planning on mounting them? Do you think they
could be mounted in the corner of a ceiling tile? The metal frame that the
tiles sit in could act as a further heat sink.

&gt;<i> Because this was looking like a project that wouldn't involve any coding
</I>&gt;<i> I have tagged on some plans to make a stupidly complex control system.
</I>&gt;<i> The plan now has a switch and relay for each LED so that they can be

</I>&gt;<i> sensing of what position the toggle switches are in and then make a web
</I>&gt;<i> page on doorbot that can control the lights. We could also put some
</I>&gt;<i> intelligence in there to have automatic lights... 
</I>
While you are devising this you could incorporate the EL wire I put in the door
yesterday? The current set up isn't ideal, it wont be long before someone
leaves it on and we come back to a dead sign.
