<PRE>I'll be along from 7ish with new toys and stuff to poke at and tea
instead of gin (more on that later). 

I'll be putting together some slides with pictures explaining what
EMFCamp is, what we did, what we (I) learned and why we should care
about these things.

I plan to start forcing myself upon y'all at about 8pm and I plan to 
video record my face speaking.
Hopefully we can put it in a consolidated online place alongside other
videos of other people talking about their cool things and let more
people in the area and beyond see what we're doing.

As an aside, I'd really like to see one person speak like this on a
Tuesday - talk about what you're doing on a project, a really difficult
problem you had to overcome, something cool you're doing at work or
something you'd like to see us work on together as a group.

It doesn't need to be anything big or showy - you don't need slides, 27
8x10&quot; colour glossy photographs or have four part harmony. It could just
be &quot;this is what I'm doing, this is why it's cool, any questions or
suggestions?&quot;

I feel it'd give us a bit more of a show-and-tell centrepoint to open 
Tuesday and give new people a good reason to come along and see what
we're up to as a group. At the moment I feel there's a lot of me
drinking gin and being quite loud, which isn't really contributing to a
healthy, productive atmosphere... So let me start to fix that! Herbal
tea and show &amp; tell.

If we combine it with a video, then we can build up an archive of cool
things that people have done/are doing/think should be done, and give
new people things to look at and see before they come and see us!

Volunteers for next week? Any people who think this is a terrible idea?
Anyone have a different/varied/better idea?

Love
Hx
