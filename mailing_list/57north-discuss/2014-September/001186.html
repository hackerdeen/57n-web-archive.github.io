<PRE>Hiya

There were some techy events coming up in Aberdeen, so just a random heads
up...

   1. Explorathon - Fri 26 September
   2. Inaugural Cloud Computing User Group Event - 29th September at
   Satrosphere
   3. Aberdeen Creative Meetup - 2 October
   4. Alan Turing and the Artificial Brain RGU - Tuesday 7 October 2014 at
   6pm
   5. Northern Lights Conference - Friday 17th October
   6. CodeTheCity 2 - Sports, Fitness and Wellbeing - 18th/19th October

...just to mention, I thought the first 4 were not so well publicised.
The last 2 are probably well known, but just to mention for completeness.
Thanks to Gordon Or of ScotlandIS - <A HREF="http://www.scotlandis.com/">http://www.scotlandis.com/</A> for
mentioning #2 and #4.  #3 is just round the corner from the space and is
kind of for creative folk, but that includes hackers in my mind :)

There is, of course, Joomla Day UK next weekend, which will be awesome, as
usual, but it not so local, being in west London.  the blurb is at
<A HREF="http://joomladay.co.uk/">http://joomladay.co.uk/</A> if anyone is interested.

Afraid I can't make it down tonight, but will head in next Tuesday to get
my membership signed up.
Randomly more info below...

Cheers

Andy



*Explorathon Satrosphere - Fri 26 September*

*Inaugural Cloud Computing User Group Event - 29th September at Satrosphere*
Next Monday, there is a joint Cloud Computing User Group being launched by
the British Computing Society (BCS) and ScotlandIS. Please see details
below - well worth attending if you have an interest in Cloud Computing.
There will be a presentation from Amazon Web Services too.
Scottish Cloud Computing Network - Inaugural event 29th September
A Cloud Computing User Group
12:00-12:30         Lunch
12:30-1:30           Ian Massingham, AWS Technical Evangelist
1:30 -2:00             Establishment of the User Group / Future Plans
Satrosphere, Aberdeen. Light lunch provided.
<A HREF="http://www.satrosphere.net/">http://www.satrosphere.net/</A>    Satrosphere Science Centre, The Tramsheds,
179 Constitution Street, Aberdeen, AB24 5TU
This event has been set up at the request of a number of users / potential
users of cloud services.
The purpose of this User Group is to provide a non-vendor user group for
organisations either currently or intending to utilise cloud-based
services. So if that applies to you and you are interested in forming an
Aberdeen based group to discuss common issues or get input from different
vendors you are invited to attend this event. To assist with catering
registration is essential so please RSVP to <A HREF="http://lists.57north.co/listinfo/57north-discuss">s.a.mackay1 at rgu.ac.uk</A>
The group is being formed as an initiative between ScotlandIS, the local
British Computer Society (BCS) branch, and the Universities of Robert
Gordon and St Andrews.
ScotlandIS is the national trade body representing the IT industry. BCS -
Chartered Institute for IT are the professional body for this sector across
the UK. Robert Gordon University and St Andrews University has undertaken a
project over the last 3 years assisting software organisations move their
high-value software products to a cloud-based offering (
<A HREF="http://www.servicestothecloud.com/.">http://www.servicestothecloud.com/.</A>) This project is coming to an end. One
element of this project is the formation of a long-term interest group.
This meeting will discuss the formation of a group and the appetite for
maintaining such a group. If you wish to be added to the Scottish Cloud
Computing Network mailing list please e-mail the project manager Gordon
Baxter (<A HREF="http://lists.57north.co/listinfo/57north-discuss">Gordon.Baxter at st-andrews.ac.uk</A>)
A number of the project partners were interested in finding out further
details about the AWS Cloud Offering so we have invited Ian Massingham, AWS
Technical Evangelist to present and take questions from users on this
subject.


*Alan Turing and the Artificial Brain RGU - Tuesday 7 October 2014 at 6pm*

RGU are hosting a guest lecture on the concept of Artificial Intelligence
delivered by computer science expert Dr Ian Watson of the University of

(RGU) in Aberdeen on Tuesday 7 October 2014 at 6pm.
Entitled &#8216;Alan Turing and the Artificial Brain&#8217;, Dr Watson will draw on the
