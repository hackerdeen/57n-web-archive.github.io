<PRE>Bah, don't mention plants.
If I can drag myself away from the garden and get the smell of Bocking 14 Comfrey off my hands I'll be along and interfixhering with temperature sensors I received in the post this morning and an Arduino. 
Plants may very well be mentioned.
Talking of photographs I'll take in my camera which has a  lens that fails to extend without persuasion when the camera is switched on  . It may very well be that th a battery doesnâ€™t have the oomph to extend the lens but I don't have test lead with skinny banana plugs to stick 2mm hook probes on to test the camera on a PSU.  Trying to stay off RS as I spend a fortune every time I go on their website.

Subject: [57north-announce] 2017-05-02 - Open Tuesday!

Morning friends!

May is upon us! There are nice little plants sprouting from the ground, 
I spent some time outside and took pictures of daffodils, snowdrops 
and dandelions this weekend - you should try it!

Maybe campGND[1] is the perfect opportunity

Today is open Tuesday at 57N and all are invited to come along after
7pm!

For those of you not in the know, Tuesday evenings are open to anyone
who wishes to come to 57North, Aberdeen's hackerspace[2]! We get up to a
range of activities on Tuesday nights, including but not limited to
social contact, programming, manufacturing weird things and consuming
sugary treats. 
We usually begin at about 7, but sometimes someone will be in earlier. 
If you're unsure, ask in IRC[3]!

If you're new, I'd suggest you bring a laptop, and perhaps a project you
want to work on.

If you're coming in, feel free to reply and tell us all what you're
planning to do!

I will be fiddling with something, idk what. I might even make it in
tonight!
