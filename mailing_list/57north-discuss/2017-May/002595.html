I shan't be in, I am really sorry. I have a flight at 0600 tomorrow and
need to have slept before boarding the plane. 

In lieu of my visit you should all be preparing to go camping at
campgnd! 

I now have a boost converter for the network, which I will be playing
with next week to make sure the point to point wireless links will turn
on.


&gt;<i> I will be fiddling with something, idk what. I might even make it in
</I>&gt;<i> tonight!
