<PRE>No de-cobwebbing for me tonight as I've been building my pest control team by transplanting spider egg sacs and hoverfly eggs  into the greenhouse over the weekend.
I'm off to Pecha Kucha tonight to listen to a bunch of talks 20 slides, 20s each.
I might be in after 20:30 / 21:00 hrs-ish but don’t have any projects in mind as I'm running late to get my bits and flask together.

Subject: [57north-announce] Open Tuesday 2017-05-23

Good Tuesday everyone!

Week 3 of may has come,  and the weather promises to be great again
this week.
If you've not considered it, maybe coming to campGND[1] would be a great
way to get rid of the last of this year's winter cobwebs. Drinks,
hacking and
relaxing in a field with friends, what more could you want?

Anyway....

Today is open Tuesday at 57N and all are invited to come along after
7pm!

For those of you not in the know, Tuesday evenings are open to anyone
who wishes to come to 57North, Aberdeen's hackerspace[2]! We get up to a
range of activities on Tuesday nights, including but not limited to
social contact, programming, manufacturing weird things and consuming
sugary treats. 
We usually begin at about 7, but sometimes someone will be in earlier. 
If you're unsure, ask in IRC[3]!

If you're new, I'd suggest you bring a laptop, and perhaps a project you
want to work on.

If you're coming in, feel free to reply and tell us all what you're
planning to do!

I shall be in, planning hard for campGND[1] and probably doing crimes.
