<PRE>I had a late night last night reworking a board and hunting for bits and pieces to make up leads. I was going to be potting up tomatoes after a trip to B&amp;Q for peat-free but my lift has bailed on me, so I will probably be in once I get my shizzle together.
I've a few things going on:

Recharge low cells in a Makita battery pack that won’t charge or perhaps just make up lead to do so.
Lens error on compact digital camera.
Investigate LED conversion for some incan flashlights.
Fiddle with Arduino / NodeMCU / Lua.
I have an Onshape file to 3D print and I'll be looking for an onshape file or dimensions for a panel to print (might need to go to Belmont Street for that.

Subject: [57north-announce] Open Tuesday 2017-05-16

Happy Tuesday everyone!

May marches on, we are now over two weeks in to this fine month!
The weather has been glorious recently and some of us have gone
outdoors!
If you've not managed yet, maybe campGND[1] is the perfect
opportunity...

Come out camping in June and enjoy our company!

Anyway....

Today is open Tuesday at 57N and all are invited to come along after
7pm!

For those of you not in the know, Tuesday evenings are open to anyone
who wishes to come to 57North, Aberdeen's hackerspace[2]! We get up to a
range of activities on Tuesday nights, including but not limited to
social contact, programming, manufacturing weird things and consuming
sugary treats. 
We usually begin at about 7, but sometimes someone will be in earlier. 
If you're unsure, ask in IRC[3]!

If you're new, I'd suggest you bring a laptop, and perhaps a project you
want to work on.

If you're coming in, feel free to reply and tell us all what you're
planning to do!

I shall be in, planning hard for campGND[1] electricity.
