Hello Everyone,

I thought I'd give everyone a heads-up, there is an Open Rights Group
Scotland Launch event this Friday, the details are below. If you are
interested come along, or if know someone who may be interested, pass
the details along.

Doc

Open Rights Group are launching a Scottish Section, We are having three
events for the launch in Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Glasgow, you can find
information - <A HREF="https://www.openrightsgroup.org/events/">https://www.openrightsgroup.org/events/</A> - The Event in
Aberdeen is organised for:

*Friday, June 26, 2015* - 6:15 PM to 8:30 PM*
Meston 6 Lecture Theatre*
	Meston Building ( North Entrance )
	King's College
	University of Aberdeen
	AB24 3UE

*Aberdeen Launch - Open Rights Group Scotland*

The Open Rights Group (ORG) is a UK-based organization that works to
preserve digital rights and freedoms by campaigning on digital rights
issues, acting as a media clearing-house service putting  journalists in
touch with experts, and by fostering a community of grass-roots activists.

*We have a talk by: WENDY GROSSMAN*
(Journalist, Activist and Open Rights Group Advisory Council):
Two years after Edward Snowden revealed the extent to which security
services, primarily the NSA and GCHQ, are collecting and storing all our
everyday communications, Britain has yet to mount a  serious public
debate on the subject. The US has passed the FREEDOM Act to end bulk
collection, and technologists everywhere are gearing up to improve
security on the Internet. As Scotland readies for further devolution,
this talk discusses the Open Rights Group's efforts to advocate for
privacy and digital rights.

*And attending will be: POL CLEMENTSMITH*
Open Rights Group's new Scotland Officer. Who will be heading up ORG's
campaigning in Scotland. Come listen to the talk, and tell Pol what you
think we should be working on.

*For More Information About ORG*
