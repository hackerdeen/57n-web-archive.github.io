<PRE>Hi Folks

I can't make it in this evening, just too much work on.  Beer fest on
Friday sounds good though.

I was away at a Joomla conference in Prague last few days, which was fun.
Code, drink, eat, repeat, x 3 days.

So I missed May Fayre, but the mrs, kids and in-laws went, and said it was
really good.  Alec proudly showed the the oscilator necklace he made when I
got back last night, he's well chuffed with that.  Even my ma-in-law said
it was really good, and she is vary rarely a fountain of positivity, so
that is an epic achievement.  So, just wanted to say, nice work people,
awesome!

Cheers

Andy
