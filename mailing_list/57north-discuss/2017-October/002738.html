</I>&gt;<i> If you're new, I'd suggest you bring a laptop, and perhaps a project you

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you're coming in, feel free to reply and tell us all what you're
</I>&gt;<i> planning to do!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I shall be in for around 6, and going for food at some point after.
</I>&gt;<i> Following that, either python, info-beamer, or python and infobeamer. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I will be in.

I shall try and do power calibrations for the wifi thing for this stupid
bet. This really depends on me finding an sd card that will write faster
than 86KB/s.
