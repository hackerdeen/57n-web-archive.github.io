<PRE>Dear friends

The Great 2017 Inter Hackerspaces Xmas Goodies Swap

Last two year Frack organized the *Inter Hackerspaces **X**mas **G**oodies *
*S**wap*, we had a blast!, about 15 hackerspaces signed up and send each
other awesome boxes full of surplus little bits n pieces, personal
projects, signed photos of their spaces. Make Magazine also pitched in an
send us a copy of their paper magazine to distribute to everyone. Almost as
soon as the first boxes started arriving, we saw the first unboxing videos
and pictures being posted, most spaces even made an unboxing event for the
goodies they received. Given last years success we'd love to grow the pool
of participating hackerspaces to include more spaces abroad too.

The idea:

As most hackerspaces have lots and lots of shiny little toys, tools and
useful bits lying around, but usually there's more than one of each, where
a single project might use just a single item. We thought it would be great
idea to send gift boxes to other spaces sharing our love for hacking with
them. Possibly inspiring them with project we have lost interest in, or
stuff we simply don't know how to use effectively.
Lets share, lets make new friends and lets make this a tradition that
delivers enthusiasm to all spaces around the globe like a tree with
presents underneath it used to do all those years ago.

What could be put in a box?

Monetary value isn't what we are looking for, its about sharing options,
about sharing your space's projects or possible just inspiring other spaces
to do something awesome with stuff you have a plenty but just can't figure
out.

So, stuff like:

   - PCB's of custom projects
   - A thumbdrive with pictures / details, sources from your space, maybe a
   little puzzle?
   - Little odd pieces of electronics that inspire great new projects.
   - Expensive (when bought) stuff that you have aplenty but other will
   probably never be able to get their hands on.
   - An invitation to your space, stickers, flyers etc from local hacker
   friendly places.
   - Your local foods, or the ingredients and a makefile

Possibly less than ideal stuff to receive

   -  Computer parts that most spaces will have aplenty anyway
   -  Huge machines (wont anyone think of the shipping costs)
   -  Stuff that might break in transit

Want to participate?

We'd love (honestly we do) to ship stuff all over the world, and receive
gifts from (new) friends all over the world in return. Outbound shipping
costs will be something you'd have to pay yourselves or maybe find a
sponsor for, inbound should be covered, and for once If you ship abroad,
make sure to mention its a Gift as it really is!
Pick a number of spaces of the list, at random, or by non-euclidean
distance, we don't care, and ship them a gift box.

Who, what, deadline?

You should add your space to the list on our wiki:
    <A HREF="https://frack.nl/wiki/2k17_interhackerspaces_xmas_swap">https://frack.nl/wiki/2k17_interhackerspaces_xmas_swap</A>
    List your deadline and make sure to ship somewhere before xmas.

If you have any questions, or remarks, please send me an email or reach out
to me at <A HREF="irc://irc.frack.nl/#frack">irc://irc.frack.nl/#frack</A>

For the unboxing videos and other pre-fun suff from last years, have a look
