    <HR>  
<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>Hi all. In case you haven't heard, I am moving on from my current job
at the School of Pharmacy and Life Sciences (PALS) at Robert Gordon
University, Aberdeen and relocating to Innsbruck, Austria. Land of
alpine sport, wiener schnitzel and apfelstrudel. I leave for the
mountains around early/mid September.

Following my work notice, a full-time, permanent online learning
developer position has gone up on MyJobsScotland:
<A HREF="https://www.myjobscotland.gov.uk/education/rgu/jobs/online-learning-developer-216672">https://www.myjobscotland.gov.uk/education/rgu/jobs/online-learning-developer-216672</A>
- feel free to take a look (closes 23rd May).

The details are on the job site but in a nutshell: you'd be hands-on
supporting staff with courseware and online examination development,
helping maintain lab kit PC hardware, leading in small-to-medium
projects requiring sometimes visual design (Adobe CC) and sometimes
coding (PHP,JS,Python,C#,WPF) whilst reporting to the Head of School.
The school is very encouraging of innovation in the area of teaching
technology, now more than ever. The job is rewarding for those that
like solving varied technical problems for educators whilst also
including commercial aims that help keep you connected to the
non-academic world - so a nice mix.

If anyone would like to ask any Qs about the role, feel free to email
me privately or PM me on IRC.

Cheers,
Ed (Aka Nordin)
</PRE>
