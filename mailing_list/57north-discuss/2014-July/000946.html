<PRE>Ladies and Gentlemen,

That  time of year is almost upon us! No it' not Christmas, but the time where several universities open up registration for their free E-Learning courses. Now, most of us I imagine have tried these courses at some point or another, and have either wished we had some company or have given up on it half way through.  With this in mind, does anyone fancy meeting once a week in the space to work on one (or more) of  these courses together?

Some courses I heard of being run in the past:
Stanford - AI learning and machines
Strathclyde - Forensic scene examination 
Yale - Financial Theory 
La Salle - Pharmacology 
Tufts - Blender 3D design
Harvard - Massively Parallel Computing 
UC Berkeley - Nuclear Engineering

If anyone would like to be part of the study group, please give this thread a shout. If you know which course you want to do, then add that too - other people might want to do the same, so the more the merrier. Provisional meetings are likely to be something like Wednesday night or Saturday afternoon, but this is open to suggestion.

Cheers
Calum
