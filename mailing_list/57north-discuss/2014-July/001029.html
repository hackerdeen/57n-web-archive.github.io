Maybe it is worth asking the Cacti( or Spine) devs on how best to scale Spine
to handle your network.

&gt;<i> So basically I'd like the poller.php re-written in C, (or just something

</I>
This might be not be possible. The [Spine Info][1] page lays out that it has
been built for high speed polling. Anyone coming to this problem would probably
need a really good picture of the sticking point in doing this.


A few questions:

1. How many hosts?
2. What is the target duration?
3. Have you found any technical papers/articles hitting that goal?
