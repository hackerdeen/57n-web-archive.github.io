<PRE>Over the last while I have been getting pissed off with things to do
with the space far too often for my liking. It's looking like I have a
sufficiently different idea of what the space should be and how it
should be run to others that we're regularly coming into conflict over
it. I've had enough of the agro from this and I imagine others have too. 

I'd like to step back from being as involved with the space as I have
been in the hopes that can reduce my emotional investment in it and let
me let it slide when I feel you are Doing It Wrong. I don't like to be
taking my ball and going home, I'd like to keep trying to make the space
what I want it to be, but I am just too tired of bashing my head against
this particular wall.

In my ideal world, now I've made this decision, I'd just quietly start
ignoring you all - but I'd rather not just drop the space infrastructure
that I've been looking after. So, I'm looking for volunteers to take
over responsibility for doorbot and, if Iain doesn't want to do it
himself, hackhub. 

Hackhub is a pretty simple python/Flask CRUD webapp so shouldn't be too
tricky to pick up for anyone that knows python and/or web development. 

doorbot involves a wider range of tech (but each bit is pretty simple):
electronic stuff to control the strike plate, an arduino to interface
that to the PC, and then another python/Flask webapp to provide the
interface to trigger opening the door from hackhub. 
The code side of doorbot is at <A HREF="https://github.com/ormiret/doorbot">https://github.com/ormiret/doorbot</A>
And a sketch of the circuitry plus some explanation of how it works:
<A HREF="https://57north.co/wiki/Doorbot">https://57north.co/wiki/Doorbot</A>

I'm happy to go over any of the details with anyone who's willing to
take either of these on.

Robert
