<PRE>In one of my rare moments of paying attention to twitter today I noticed
@57NorthHacklab had tweeted &quot;No Emergency! Stop the Data Retention
stitch-up! Email your MP now.
<A HREF="https://www.openrightsgroup.org/campaigns/no-emergency-stop-the-data-retention-stitch-up">https://www.openrightsgroup.org/campaigns/no-emergency-stop-the-data-retention-stitch-up</A>&quot;
<A HREF="https://twitter.com/57NorthHacklab/status/487270406227648512">https://twitter.com/57NorthHacklab/status/487270406227648512</A>

As much as I might agree with the sentiment I'd rather the space wasn't
taking a stance on any political issues. I think being as apolitical as
possible[1] is the only way to be inclusive. 

I'm also really uncomfortable with any kind of statement coming from an
account purporting to be &quot;57 North Hacklab&quot; when it's actually just
whoever has control of the account and hasn't been discussed by the
wider group, so there isn't consensus among 57 North that we want to say
that. I think we need to be careful to keep personal opinions of
individual members/directors separate from anything purporting to come
from the whole group.

[1] There is some politics in the very existence of the space, but I'd
want that to be the extent of the politics the space is involved in.
