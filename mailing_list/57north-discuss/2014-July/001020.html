<PRE>Hi,

Well, I think I underwhelmed everyone with my Parallella last Tue, but I
still think it's very interesting! In particular, the Zync 7010 and I've
just discovered this book about it (free PDF download):

  <A HREF="http://www.zynqbook.com/">http://www.zynqbook.com/</A>

[The Zync is the SoC that hosts the Epiphany parallel processor]

Still struggling with the USB, though - Spent more money than I really
wanted to on a Belkin F4U018-BLK 7-port powered USB hub from Staples
this afternoon (don't ask) just so I could buy it over the counter...

Adapteva recommend the Belkin F4U018-BLK for use with Parallella and,
although it appears to have the same USB ID as the cheapo Maplin ones I
was having problems with, it does seem to work:

  05e3:0608 Genesys Logic, Inc. USB-2.0 4-Port HUB

The Maplin 'Cerulian' USB hubs are no-brand ones made in China and not
on the list of conforming USB hubs:

  <A HREF="http://goo.gl/DL054C">http://goo.gl/DL054C</A>

Another thing I found out about while looking into this is USB OTG (USB
On The Go), which I'd never heard about: It's a way for a USB port to
switch between master and slave according to what's plugged into it.

Now, the Parallella spec. says it has USB OTG and I wonder if this might
be part of the problem because USB OTG uses the capacitance of cables
and devices to work out what has been connected - USB OMG :-)

Going to do a Parallella demo at the University of St. Andrews on Wed,
so I probably won't be in the Space on Tue because I still have to write
my talk...

Bye,

  Tony.
