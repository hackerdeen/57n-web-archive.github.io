<PRE>Hi Robert,

Sometimes it can get that way.

I had a look at this and it looks well written. Just to share my story I 
was a computer programmer from the Z80 days when tinkering with the 
hardware wasn't really doable. Cut 20 or so years and after getting 
involved in my local hackerspace I was doing all sorts of things I never 
knew about before.

These are some of my blog/photo posts:

&gt;<i> doorbot involves a wider range of tech (but each bit is pretty simple):
</I>&gt;<i> electronic stuff to control the strike plate, an arduino to interface
</I>&gt;<i> that to the PC, and then another python/Flask webapp to provide the
</I>&gt;<i> interface to trigger opening the door from hackhub.
</I>&gt;<i> The code side of doorbot is at <A HREF="https://github.com/ormiret/doorbot">https://github.com/ormiret/doorbot</A>
</I>&gt;<i> And a sketch of the circuitry plus some explanation of how it works:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://57north.co/wiki/Doorbot">https://57north.co/wiki/Doorbot</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm happy to go over any of the details with anyone who's willing to
</I>&gt;<i> take either of these on.
</I>
Looks pretty good.

Globally (I'm told) lots are chasing the Internet-of-Things type 
solutions. I've been doing a similar thing for the Attiny85 which is 
smaller and cheaper.

Regards

David
