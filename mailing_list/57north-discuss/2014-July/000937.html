Hi, Merlin.

AFAIK, we are not an open rights group: We are just a group of hackers
interested in learning about and using disruptive technology, sharing
our knowledge and promoting open standards through a non-profit company
funded by member contributions.

Many of us have liberal views, and our own political agenda, but the
only members of 57North who actually have a right to speak on behalf of
57North as a company are its directors, who own the 57North accounts.

The directors, of course, have a responsibility to represent the aims
and objectives of 57North in the public arena. However, members also
have a responsibility to contribute to a consensus about our aims and
objectives too.

Talking about members' rights is the wrong approach in my opinion and
it's symptomatic of 'blame' culture. What I hope will emerge from our
Hackspace is a cooperative culture with a collective view of socially
acceptable ways of doing things like in the Debian Social Contract.

BTW, please don't top-post a reply to the entire 57North email digest!

Bye,

  Tony.
