Hi again, everybody.

I'm looking to find a PHP Guru with time on their hands who would be willing to look at the code for my message board. ( <A HREF="http://www.paranormal.org.uk/mustardland">http://www.paranormal.org.uk/mustardland</A> )

I tried asking on your IRC channel a couple of days ago, but I picked a bad time to look in, as from what I could tell there was only one &quot;real&quot; person there and a few bots keeping the channel open.

A little back-story...

Back in 2005, I set up this board with my friend Bob.  Bob customised the PHPBB2 software extensively, *just* before PHPBB3 was released, and thus we've been running that ever since.  But last September, sadly, Bob died, and we haven't got anybody who can finish off the modules he was working on at the time.  His complete lack of documentation or comments may also prove a problem...

If money is a motivation, several of our board's users have offered to chip in to pay someone to sort things out.  If other things motivate you, we may be able to organise trades... (We have everybody from published authors to web designers on the board, just no PHP Guru at the moment.)

If you're interested in helping out, or know someone else who might be, get in touch, please.

The board is a heavily customised PHPBB2 running under PHP 5.2. (It won't run under any later version...)

Thanks,

Peet

(The reason for posting to the list rather than coming in and asking in person is because I've just been given a string of medical appointments that pretty much screws up my next two to three weeks...)
