<PRE>Hi Peet,

I know PHP, but I am no Guru. But I will reach out to my PHP friends.

The concern here is its a very very outdated base, and there are security
concerns with using old php (5.2 released 2010).

It might be better to work out these 'custom modules' and see how they can
be done with the current phpbb and php.

I will let you know if I find someone who may be willing to help out.

Cheers,
Rowan.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A little back-story...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Back in 2005, I set up this board with my friend Bob.  Bob customised the

</I>&gt;<i> we've been running that ever since.  But last September, sadly, Bob died,
</I>&gt;<i> and we haven't got anybody who can finish off the modules he was working on
</I>&gt;<i> at the time.  His complete lack of documentation or comments may also prove
</I>&gt;<i> a problem...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If money is a motivation, several of our board's users have offered to

</I>&gt;<i> we may be able to organise trades... (We have everybody from published
</I>&gt;<i> authors to web designers on the board, just no PHP Guru at the moment.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you're interested in helping out, or know someone else who might be,
</I>&gt;<i> get in touch, please.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The board is a heavily customised PHPBB2 running under PHP 5.2. (It won't
</I>&gt;<i> run under any later version...)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Peet
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> (The reason for posting to the list rather than coming in and asking in
</I>&gt;<i> person is because I've just been given a string of medical appointments
</I>&gt;<i> that pretty much screws up my next two to three weeks...)
