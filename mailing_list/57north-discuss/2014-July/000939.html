<PRE>Hi,

The Ludum Dare competition will be running again from August 22nd to August
25th. Ludum Dare is an Online Game Jam event where people from around the
world create a game in a weekend.

Ludum Dare is two similar events taking place over one weekend.

The Competition is the familiar &#8220;make a game in 48 hours solo competition&#8221;
that Ludum Dare is known for. Specific details can be found below. After the
competition ends, participants are given 3 weeks to play and rate games
created by their peers. After those 3 weeks, winners are announced.

The Jam is the new &#8220;relaxed&#8221; Ludum Dare. It was created to make Ludum Dare
even more inclusive. You can work in a team, borrow assets from your other
projects, or do things that would normally be against the rules. You also
get one extra day, giving you up to 72 hours to submit an entry. This is
helpful for those times real life gets in the way, or for games that need
just a bit more time to become something great.

Unfortunately, I am going to be busy on this weekend, so someone will need
to volunteer to run this. Once we have a volunteer, we can get this loaded
up in Open Tech Calendar and get our meetup published on the Ludum Dare
website which will allow others in the local area to see that we're holding
a meetup and might even attract us a few new members.

Iain.
