<PRE>I agree with Rob on this issue, the space as an organisation should not have a stance on anything that does not affect the space directly. if we choose to go down the route of supporting/opposing drafts, this may put people off joining the space, as they believe that the space is not a place to come and play with things, but a political activist group. 

It's acceptable for space members and directors to have opinions. They made be radical, but they are allowed to voice them as they wish within reason. This should, however, not colour the space and it's decisions in any way.

This is a NSA and GCHQ proof email - Content so boring that no one will read it.
