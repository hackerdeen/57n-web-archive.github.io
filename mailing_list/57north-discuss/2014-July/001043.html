<PRE>It appears that at least 3 members of the space will be going to [EMF Camp][1]
at the end of August. As I understand other hackerspace will have tents in the
hackerspace village. While I think we should be part of this I don't think any
of us have the time to set something cool for that up. 

Instead I thought it would be cool to fly some flags representing the space. I
would like to make simple two sided flags of our [Coat of Arms][2] and our
[Logo][3]. 

To make these we would need some stencils made up. I am hope less at making
stencils.

Does anyone in the space think they could make these in the next two weeks or
so?
