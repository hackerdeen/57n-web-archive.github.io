And three of the directors work for Aberdeen University - have we taken
a stance to agree with Aberdeen University? What 57N collectively
does/agrees with/says is different from what individual or groups of
members or directors do.

I see a big difference between sharing information on technology (part
of the founding purpose of the space) and campaigning on political
issues.
