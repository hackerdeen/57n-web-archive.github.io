Hi,

I'm going to contact Petrotechnics to see if Kit has wiped the disks on
those other scrap servers yet. I've asked him to tell me what the spec.
is because I don't want to bring any more non-VM-capable Xeon servers
with hardly any RAM and ancient 73GB SCSI disks into the space...

However, anyone who is interested in them can contact Kit directly:

  Kit Wright &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.57north.co/listinfo/57north-discuss">holidayhalflife at gmail.com</A>&gt;

We still have the option of repairing some of the 2U Rackable Systems
servers that I donated. I'm going to give the broken servers and parts
to Tom and Iain who will decide what can be salvaged and reused. I'll
use six of the 2U cases for my garage cluster project. There should be
ten other systems including the one that I gave to Tom already.

Bye,

  Tony.
