Thanks for that, I was actually considering picking one up. If they are that
much of a nightmare I won't bother.

&gt;<i> If you're going to spend &#163;29, go onto eBay and get a used Kindle 3rd
</I>&gt;<i> generation, with the keyboard.  You can hack those to use them as a (slow)
</I>&gt;<i> free 3G dongle. :-)
</I>
I have also been thinking of getting a good kindle again, it will go on my list.

&gt;<i> (Sorry for butting in.  I'm the guy who wanted to attend, but the three days
</I>&gt;<i> you're &quot;open&quot; are the three days I'm on kidney dialysis...)
</I>
We are of course open sporadically everyday. While Tuesday's,Thursday's and
Saturday's we are planning on being open. Any time you can make it in you should
ask the list or on irc.

Most of the time there is someone waiting for someone else to hack with.
