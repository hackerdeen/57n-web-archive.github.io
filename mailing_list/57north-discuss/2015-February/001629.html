<PRE>Hey,

I have a pretty good condition Microsoft Sidewinder X4 gaming keyboard (it&#8217;s pretty hefty!) which I bought off eBay a while ago. I wanted it because it has N-key rollover (key combos never conflict), which meant, among other things, that you could use it for Plover, a stenotype engine - which, if I went to the bother of spending three months getting proficient at it, would allow me to type at inhuman speeds (see this excellent talk: <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpv-Qb-dB6g">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wpv-Qb-dB6g</A>). However, I&#8217;m notoriously lazy and haven&#8217;t bothered to actually use it to learn Plover. Just as with learning the piano and Japanese, I didn&#8217;t put in the effort to actually learn the damn things, but I *did* waste money on peripherals in the process&#8230;

Anyhow, if someone wants it, I&#8217;d be happy to give it to them. It has little stenotype key caps on top of the normal keys so you can align your fingers correctly for Plover, but it you don&#8217;t want them, you can remove them - they are just stick-on. 

If you want to give me money for it, you can, but it doesn&#8217;t really matter, I just want to avoid keeping this massive keyboard (and box) lying around that I&#8217;m not using.

I won&#8217;t bother describing the item in detail here because in this magical information age, you can find full specs etc on teh interwebs.

Any takers? :)
