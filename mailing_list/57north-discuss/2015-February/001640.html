<PRE>*1. Your Name (nick):*
Sean Reilly (Isandor)

*2. Your Background*
I have been here in Aberdeen my whole life. Ever since I got my first
computer (with crappy Windows 98 on it), I've been interested in
programming. I went to Aberdeen College (which is now North East Scotland
College) and, after four years there, I got into third year at the
University of Aberdeen. I have very recently got interested in the hardware
and electronics side of things. I am generally very helpful to others
(perhaps a bit too much, some of my grades could have been better had I not
helped about four other people at the same time!).

*3. Your Hacklab-related Interests*
As I mentioned previously, I have just recently gotten into electronics.
I've had a Raspberry Pi sitting around for ages, and I've been using it as
a music player hooked up to my TV. However, I want to convert it into a
proper music player for myself and get rid of the TV. Once this is done, I
look forward to working with all sorts of electronics and even some
woodworking projects (I will need a case for it). Last week, I was shown
around, and everyone there was really nice and helpful. Finally, I've
always dreamed of having a cardboard box with my name on it, and now my
life-long dream can come true!

*4. What knowledge can you bring hacklab community?*
I currently know plenty about programming: Java, Python, C, C++, and
Javascript. I'm just getting into hardware and electronics hacking at the
moment, so I unfortunately don't know much about that. I am generally quite
good at solving problems though, and I'd be happy to help or work together
with anyone else in the Space. I can also donate various items when I get
my hands on some...

*5. What do you wish to learn from the hacklab community?*
The main thing I want to learn is how to go about hacking electronics and
using the various tools (for example, I have never used a soldering iron
before). Similarly, I'd love to do some woodworking stuff too and learn how
to not cut my own arm off in the process.
