&gt;<i> 1. Your Name (nick):
</I>&gt;<i> Sean Reilly (Isandor)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Your Background
</I>&gt;<i> I have been here in Aberdeen my whole life. Ever since I got my first
</I>&gt;<i> computer (with crappy Windows 98 on it), I've been interested in
</I>&gt;<i> programming. I went to Aberdeen College (which is now North East Scotland
</I>&gt;<i> College) and, after four years there, I got into third year at the
</I>&gt;<i> University of Aberdeen. I have very recently got interested in the hardware
</I>&gt;<i> and electronics side of things. I am generally very helpful to others
</I>&gt;<i> (perhaps a bit too much, some of my grades could have been better had I not
</I>&gt;<i> helped about four other people at the same time!).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Your Hacklab-related Interests
</I>&gt;<i> As I mentioned previously, I have just recently gotten into electronics.
</I>&gt;<i> I've had a Raspberry Pi sitting around for ages, and I've been using it as a
</I>&gt;<i> music player hooked up to my TV. However, I want to convert it into a proper
</I>&gt;<i> music player for myself and get rid of the TV. Once this is done, I look
</I>&gt;<i> forward to working with all sorts of electronics and even some woodworking
</I>&gt;<i> projects (I will need a case for it). Last week, I was shown around, and
</I>&gt;<i> everyone there was really nice and helpful. Finally, I've always dreamed of
</I>&gt;<i> having a cardboard box with my name on it, and now my life-long dream can
</I>&gt;<i> come true!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4. What knowledge can you bring hacklab community?
</I>&gt;<i> I currently know plenty about programming: Java, Python, C, C++, and
</I>&gt;<i> Javascript. I'm just getting into hardware and electronics hacking at the
</I>&gt;<i> moment, so I unfortunately don't know much about that. I am generally quite
</I>&gt;<i> good at solving problems though, and I'd be happy to help or work together
</I>&gt;<i> with anyone else in the Space. I can also donate various items when I get my
</I>&gt;<i> hands on some...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 5. What do you wish to learn from the hacklab community?
</I>&gt;<i> The main thing I want to learn is how to go about hacking electronics and
</I>&gt;<i> using the various tools (for example, I have never used a soldering iron
</I>&gt;<i> before). Similarly, I'd love to do some woodworking stuff too and learn how
</I>&gt;<i> to not cut my own arm off in the process.
