That's fine, I don't see the capability offered by the hot air station.
Different people use the space for different things.

This is not so much the purchase of a radio alone, this is towards
setting up a usable shack that is available 24 hours a day for &quot;drop in&quot;
and &quot;zero setup&quot; use by members.

&gt;<i> Right now I think all of our radio curious members have a radio and a

The goal is not just to have a radio, but to have it set up and
documented in a way that it can be used. The antenna setup will be just
as important as the radio, which we already mostly have and hibby has
put a lot of work in to.

&gt;<i> I think this amount of money would be better directed to a more general
</I>&gt;<i> fabrication tool, or hand/power tools than a specific item few people
</I>&gt;<i> can use.
</I>
Ok, but the value to the hackerspace is not zero. Let's work out what a
sensible contribution would be from the hackerspace and what a sensible
contribution would be from members. It's also possible we don't hit
enough pledges to buy it and we just don't buy it.

Thanks,
Iain.
