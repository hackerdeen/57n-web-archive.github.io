that is a shame, can you not think of any uses for the hot air station?

I can't see what NEW capability this offers over the Â£5000+ of radios
already owned by the space membership.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
There is already space in the hackerspace for a shack and it has radios
and can without too much hassle have antennas. What NEW capabilty does
this add?

I have been adjacent to a lot of radio this year and it is clear to me
that this offers anything new to what the space has other than it being
shiny.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ok, but the value to the hackerspace is not zero. Let's work out what a

</I>
I think that is a good idea, get pledges towards the total and ask the
hackerspace to cover any shortfall.

I don't think it is correct for the space to be the first in this
negotiation.
