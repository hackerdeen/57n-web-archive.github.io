<PRE>Hi All,

We would have the option of getting a Kenwood TS-2000X for the space for
Â£850 from a local radio amateur that is having a clear out.

<A HREF="https://kenwoodcommunications.co.uk/files/file/comms/uk/brochures/amateur/TS2000web1.pdf">https://kenwoodcommunications.co.uk/files/file/comms/uk/brochures/amateur/TS2000web1.pdf</A>

This is a &quot;does everything&quot; radio going from HF to 23cm, and even has a
built in packet modem and automatic antenna tuner.

This would also include an MC-60 desk microphone and a DTMF fist microphone.

I could see this being used for:

* getting into HF bands that you don't have the garden space for at home
* contesting as the MS0SCZ club
* the GB1RST special event station
* training hackerspace members
* receiving things like the Shortwave Radiogram
* doing some of these things remotely (remote control software is
available for this radio)

Operation guidelines would look roughly like:

<A HREF="https://wiki.london.hackspace.org.uk/view/Amateur_Radio/Guidelines">https://wiki.london.hackspace.org.uk/view/Amateur_Radio/Guidelines</A>

I've so far authorised the following people to operate under the MS0SCZ
license and any of those can supervise operation under that license:

Me
Allie MM0AAL
Ana MM0YSO
Hibby MM0RFN

I'm happy to extend this list for anyone that has a full license, but
those with foundation/intermediate license can also operate under their
own callsign.

This is a large purchase, but if there is interest then perhaps there is
a way we can split up cost between member pledges and hackerspace
contribution.

Recently the hackerspace has purchased an oscilloscope and a hot air
station, which not 100% of the membership will use, so there is some
precedent for the hackerspace contributing to purchases of this nature.

Thanks,
Iain.
</PRE>
