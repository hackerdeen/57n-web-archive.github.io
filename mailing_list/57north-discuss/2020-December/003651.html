I don't see the new capability this offers to the hackerspace. 

Of the previous two items we have bought (hot air station and oscilloscope)
we have frequently 'wanted' a usable scope, but been unable to access
consistent access. The hot air station was a bit of whim of mine, but I
have had great use out of the work one and it seemed like a good tool
for us to own.

Right now I think all of our radio curious members have a radio and a
spare they could lend to someone interested/the space.

I think this amount of money would be better directed to a more general
fabrication tool, or hand/power tools than a specific item few people
can use.

This radio might be a better group purchase similar to how we bought the
first two 3d printers.
