<PRE>Hi All,

I will be running a key signing party on the 19th March 2015 at 57North
Hacklab. Since a lot of the space policy depends on the directors signing
emails, we have had a push to have these keys signed by the other directors
and members of the space and have developed a web of trust within the space.
I'd like to see this grow futher, which is why I am organising this event
and also inviting the Aberdeen University Computing Science Society and
Edinburgh Hacklab along to attend.

You can see our current web of trust progress here:

  <A HREF="http://irl.sdf.org/spacekeys/">http://irl.sdf.org/spacekeys/</A>

If you already know what a keysigning party is, and would like to attend,
then all you need to do for now is sent me a copy of your public key as an
email attachment. Please put &quot;[KSP]&quot; in the subject line so that I can file
these away for now. You will need to do this on or before the 15th. On the
16th, I will futher instructions to all those that have sent me a key.

For those that do not know what a keysigning party is, you should read:

  <A HREF="https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual/x547.html">https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual/x547.html</A>

which will give you a better understanding of the web of trust concept. Even
if you do not have a key generated yet, you're welcome to come along and
observe and once the initial keysigning has been completed, there should be
time for some discussion about getting started with GPG.

If you would like to get started before the party, please do ensure that you
are generating a secure key. It should be at least 4096 bits unless you have
a good reason, and you should also configure GPG to use SHA2 or better. See
more details about key generation here:

  <A HREF="http://keyring.debian.org/creating-key.html">http://keyring.debian.org/creating-key.html</A>

Thanks,
Iain.

P.S. Please send follow ups either directly to me or to the 57North
discussion list. Please send your public keys only to me, I will distribute
these to participants on the 16th.
