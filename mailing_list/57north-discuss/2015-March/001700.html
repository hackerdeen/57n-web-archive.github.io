<PRE>Hello there,

I'm Tomas Chmelevskij (MegaMolis)

I'm first year computing student with a background in many quite random
things.
Ever since little lego was my favourite toy, so interest in taking things
apart is
quite genuine. In my life I've already done quite a lot of things, I have a
vocational
qualification in Mechatronics and worked as an gig technician for couple of
years
before moving to Scotland, through my career made a lot of different things
from small led fixtures to CNC machine and giant 6 meter tall pink chair.
I'm
really multicultural person speaking 4 human languages and trying to master
some
machine ones.

In the last year I've spent most of my time learning programming so the
most interesting thing for me would be to learn programming and networking.

As an individual with a lot of random knowledge I could help a lot with
things related
to bicycles, materials or manufacturing.

On your website I've noticed that there is quite a lot of developers in
your community
so as a newbie programmer I always have a really random simple question
which
only human being with computer brains can explain.

As for the photo sorry guys don't have anything, but will pop in tomorrow ;)

Cheers Tom
