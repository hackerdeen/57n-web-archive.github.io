values with a cron job every 5 mins to my VPS, where they would be added
to the RRDs and graphs made there for the webpage.

</I>I did get it working for a page to track how many folk are in the
Puregym round the corner - I don't like to go when it is busy. You can
view the basic page here: <A HREF="http://carlanderson.co.uk/gym.php">http://carlanderson.co.uk/gym.php</A>
Seems to be OK, but they do not update the figure overnight (I guess
some of their servers go to sleep of something :P)
I'll take notes this time and write something for the wiki.

Cheers.
