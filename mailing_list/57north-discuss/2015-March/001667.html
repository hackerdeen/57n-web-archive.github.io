<PRE>Hello Peet,
As Ed mentioned, we're putting together a printer at the space, which should hopefully be operational before too long. In the meantime, i'm happy to lend my own printer to the cause.
Unfortunately, my build volume is also significantly smaller that you are after - cylindrical, 170mm diameter x 240mm height. I could do small-scale prototypes, or perhaps your design could be printed in parts and assembled?
As for metal-look, if you're into brass or copper, both my printer and the one under construction should handle things like this: (<A HREF="http://e3d-online.com/Filament/By-Material/Composites/ColorFabb-Bronzefill-1.75mm-750g">http://e3d-online.com/Filament/By-Material/Composites/ColorFabb-Bronzefill-1.75mm-750g</A>), although I don't know of anything similar in chrome-effect.
Sorry to hear about the leg, wishing you a smooth recovery!
Arthur

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Does anybody have access to a 3D printer that could produce sections about

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; bonus, but if not I'll be looking for somewhere that'll do &quot;Chroming&quot; by the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; electrostatic process too.

</I>&gt;<i> Hi Peet, good to hear from you. Myself and Arthur are in the process
</I>&gt;<i> of building a 3d printer for the space (a Prusa i2). We just need to
</I>&gt;<i> buy are few more items and we'll be done. It has a 225x225x210mm build
</I>&gt;<i> area, so not quite the 350x200x100mm you are seeking, but can be used
</I>&gt;<i> freely once running.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I ask because, as you may not know, since I signed up I've had one of my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; legs cut off below the knee, and I'm currently resident at ARI.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Whoa, sorry to hear that. Hope things are comfortable.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I don't fancy the look of the &quot;official&quot; prosthetic legs, so I plan to construct a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; T800 (Terminator) &quot;shell&quot; to fit over the one I have been issued with.  I
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; think this is a project worthy of involving the Hackspace.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Affirmative.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; For example, I'd like to &quot;acquire&quot; a small low-power piece of electronics
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that can detect the impact of a step and make a high-brightness red LED fade
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; in and out over about a second.  I would place this inside the &quot;shell&quot; so
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the LED glowed through any holes.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cool. So MSP430s run on practically nothing or otherwise your common
</I>&gt;<i> AVRs will do fine I'd imagine. Bright LEDs will be the power hungry
</I>&gt;<i> parts, but your batt can be fairly large I would guess
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Anybody who would like to get involved with this project can contact me via
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (From Monday) Ward 108, Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, Foresterhill Road,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Aberdeen AB25 2ZN, or call me on 0744 339 0028.  (If I don't answer, call
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; again in a couple of minutes - my Blackberry isn't always in reach of my
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; wheelchair...)  Or, of course, just email me at <A HREF="http://lists.57north.co/listinfo/57north-discuss">Peet42 at Netscape.net</A> .
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cool. I will bring it up when next in the space and see who else is
</I>&gt;<i> also interested. Also, If you have time on your hands and a topic of
</I>&gt;<i> interest - you might wont to consider a 57N newsletter article for
</I>&gt;<i> Toms upcoming release mid March. He's keen to collect these.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Ed (Nordin)
