I should be along. I'm planning to have a play around with some of the
bits I have for building a sunrise simulator (alarm clock with a
bright light).

The Wed 17th TechMeetup doesn't happen till June. Sooner, tomorrow,
Wed 18th there is this months TechMeetup with Kenny Coyle talking
about open source recording stuff. 

From Bruce's announcement: 

&gt;<i>For a number of years, Kenny has been involved with recording and
</I>&gt;<i>documenting of talks during the annual KDE conference - Akademy. Out
</I>&gt;<i>of principle, talks are recorded using entirely Free and Open Source
</I>&gt;<i>technology (with the only exception of the cameras in a few
</I>&gt;<i>cases). During this talk, Kenny will show how a number of simple Open
</I>&gt;<i>Source tools make this possible, where the challenges lie and (if
</I>&gt;<i>possible) - provide a live demo of some of these tools. This talk
</I>&gt;<i>will conclude with an overview of plans for the future and details of
</I>&gt;<i>the experimentation with different workflows and how these will be
</I>&gt;<i>implemented at the upcoming conference in A Coru&#241;a.
