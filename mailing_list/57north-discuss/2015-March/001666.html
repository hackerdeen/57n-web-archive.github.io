Hi Peet, good to hear from you. Myself and Arthur are in the process
of building a 3d printer for the space (a Prusa i2). We just need to
buy are few more items and we'll be done. It has a 225x225x210mm build
area, so not quite the 350x200x100mm you are seeking, but can be used
freely once running.

&gt;<i> I ask because, as you may not know, since I signed up I've had one of my
</I>&gt;<i> legs cut off below the knee, and I'm currently resident at ARI.
</I>
Whoa, sorry to hear that. Hope things are comfortable.

&gt;<i> I don't fancy the look of the &quot;official&quot; prosthetic legs, so I plan to construct a
</I>&gt;<i> T800 (Terminator) &quot;shell&quot; to fit over the one I have been issued with.  I
</I>&gt;<i> think this is a project worthy of involving the Hackspace.
</I>
Affirmative.

&gt;<i> For example, I'd like to &quot;acquire&quot; a small low-power piece of electronics
</I>&gt;<i> that can detect the impact of a step and make a high-brightness red LED fade
</I>&gt;<i> in and out over about a second.  I would place this inside the &quot;shell&quot; so
</I>&gt;<i> the LED glowed through any holes.
</I>
Cool. So MSP430s run on practically nothing or otherwise your common
AVRs will do fine I'd imagine. Bright LEDs will be the power hungry
parts, but your batt can be fairly large I would guess

&gt;<i> Anybody who would like to get involved with this project can contact me via
</I>&gt;<i> (From Monday) Ward 108, Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, Foresterhill Road,
</I>&gt;<i> Aberdeen AB25 2ZN, or call me on 0744 339 0028.  (If I don't answer, call
</I>&gt;<i> again in a couple of minutes - my Blackberry isn't always in reach of my
</I>&gt;<i> wheelchair...)  Or, of course, just email me at <A HREF="http://lists.57north.co/listinfo/57north-discuss">Peet42 at Netscape.net</A> .
</I>
Cool. I will bring it up when next in the space and see who else is
also interested. Also, If you have time on your hands and a topic of
interest - you might wont to consider a 57N newsletter article for
Toms upcoming release mid March. He's keen to collect these.

Cheers,
Ed (Nordin)
