<PRE>Hi,

Many thanks for making me feel very welcome at the last two open Tuesdays;
I really enjoyed my visits. Unfortunately I was unable to come along today,
but I have enclosed information below with regard to the membership
application introduction.

Regards,

Utkarsh.

1. Your Name (nick):

Utkarsh Kulkarni (utkarsh)

2. Your Background

I&#8217;m a physician by day (and night when on-call), with a reasonably healthy
interest in matters technological.

3. Your Hacklab-related Interests

I&#8217;m interested in the design and construction of computers and associated
hardware. I also have a fascination for human-machine interfaces.

4. What knowledge can you bring hacklab community?

I don&#8217;t understand code at all, but I do have some experience with very
low-budget non-orbital hardware. My enthusiasm is for reviving and
repurposing older hardware.

5. What do you wish to learn from the hacklab community?

I would like to revive my interest in hardware, which has been sidelined a
little of late due to other commitments, and to learn from others with
varied interests that overlap with my own.
