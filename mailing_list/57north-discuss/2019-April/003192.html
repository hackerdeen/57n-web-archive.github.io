<PRE>Hi all - I have stripped down the hothead of the space Kossel 3D
printer and it's awaiting a replacement hothead and reinsulation. This
means its out of action until I can fit that replacement from next
week.

After experiments heat-insulating the hot-head last night, it was
still pulling more juice then it should and burning the insulation
rather than improving the heat stability at tip. This is due to the
hot element being a bad fit inside the head's housing, causing it to
compensate with over-heating. Probably due both to overheating and
lack of strain relief, the backend of the element has degraded and is
exposing the 12v copper connections which is asking for a short. Since
the heating element came from the supplier like that and is tightly
wedged inside the Kossel's head, its better off being replaced with
the old Prusa's E3D head I have at home. I'll probably switch-out some
other parts too as I have better quality versions at home that I don't
really use.

Cheers,
Nordin
</PRE>
