<PRE>Hi All,

Our space network got lots of changes yesterday. There are still more
changes planned. The primary change that you might notice is that the IP
addresses we are using are changing (but not entirely yet).

In the past we've used ChaosVPN for connecting to other hackerspaces.
I'd like to switch us over to using dn42 for this purpose, which means
renumbering. Some details are already up on the wiki here:

  <A HREF="https://wiki.57north.org.uk/index.php/Projects:Network">https://wiki.57north.org.uk/index.php/Projects:Network</A>

Once this is more stable, we can look at setting up tunnels with members
if they wish to have a tunnel into the space. At first these will be
plain GRE, but later looking to support IPsec/GRE.

We are already in a position where we can look at setting up a tunnel
between the space and finzean to allow doorbot to move off of Rob's VPN.
I'll be co-ordinating with a director to get that set up as I don't have
access to finzean.

Both the EdgeRouter X and EdgeRouter Lite have been replaced by a single
apu3c4 board running OpenBSD, which is set up pretty much exactly like
my home router.

  <A HREF="https://iain.learmonth.me/blog/2018/2018w431/">https://iain.learmonth.me/blog/2018/2018w431/</A>

The exception is that it's not got its own GPS time source (yet) for the
NTP server. Given its position we might need to get creative with that.

I am going to look at lunchtime at fixing the DHCP static leases. Some
things may need turned off and back on again to get the lease you're
expecting. I'll cycle the switch ports to try to get things to do the
right thing but that might not be enough.

We currently do not have IPv6. I'm not sure if this worked before, but
the tunnel set up as previously configured doesn't seem to work in the
new setup. The tunnel may have been disabled if it was found to be
broken for a while, and I don't have the access to check the admin panel
for that.

The space network has currently been taken back to 100Mbps Ethernet due
to the need to support VLANs on our core switch and the rack being not
deep enough for any of the Gigabit switches we have.

This switch is probably what we want to put in there:


<A HREF="https://www.amazon.co.uk/NETGEAR-GS724Tv4-24-Port-Lifetime-Protection/dp/B00GZNAHOA">https://www.amazon.co.uk/NETGEAR-GS724Tv4-24-Port-Lifetime-Protection/dp/B00GZNAHOA</A>

It's a good balance of having a good set of features, Gigabit Ethernet,
and price, while also being shallow enough to fit our rack. It has the
added bonus of being fanless, so shouldn't track in dust from the dirty
workshop area.

Finally, I'll be in the space tonight testing and documenting the setup.
If you have any questions, or want to get ahead in migrating to the new
addressing, come along and talk to me.

Thanks,
Iain.
