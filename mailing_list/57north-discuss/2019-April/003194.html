<PRE>Hi Ed

I think the microwave is useful. A couple of months ago I made a fairly
random burns night dinner for some french visitors with it. They were very
polite, or perhaps just quite hungry.  Next time I'm in I'll clean it up
and find a suitable location for it. We could pop it under the stairs till
then, if it's in the way.  No worries if it's already gone through.

The fridge, I'm not so sure, happy to clean it out at the same time.  Parts
of the space are often colder than a 4-6 degree centigrade fridge, so that
makes me think it's a bit redundant. Maybe in summer it'll feel more useful.

Sounds great, the Lazer cutter site now, nice work, thanks.

Cheers
Andy

&gt;<i> Hi all
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Just in update, I have built shelf in the upper floor to take the laser
</I>&gt;<i> cutter off the room's table. The fit seems good and I'd like to make it
</I>&gt;<i> permanent. More details are on the associated project page [1].
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If nobody minds, my next steps are to:
</I>&gt;<i> - Add an insert, that the window neatly closes down upon, to house fans
</I>&gt;<i> for venting and cooling to the outside
</I>&gt;<i> - Add a controlling PC, maybe either a PC board mounted inside the kit
</I>&gt;<i> itself or one of those mini-notebooks the space has spare, sat on a
</I>&gt;<i> standing-height mounted 90's swivel TV wall-shelf. The latter takes care of
</I>&gt;<i> keyboard and mouse requirements also.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Related to this, I had to relocate the (apparently) disused fridge and
</I>&gt;<i> microwave whilst I built the shelf. Both these items are looking pretty
</I>&gt;<i> grotty and appear generally unused and unmaintained. I'd like to table a
</I>&gt;<i> notion to ditch them both at the end of April *if* the membership feel we
</I>&gt;<i> either don't need these particular items.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Usual drill re comments/objections.
