&gt;<i> Are we going to run the aircon all the time? What happens when someone
</I>&gt;<i> switches it off?
</I>
The aircon won't make that much difference - 2-3C change in ambient external temperature shouldn't impact us that much. Really we need to consider our heat dissipation of the hardware mounted inside and attach appropriate cooling.

It's a safe assumption that ambient will be 19-25C, and we can stick a couple of fan &amp; filter units like [1] in, controlled by a thermostat - Typically we'll recommend 40C internal temperature as the activation temperature. I *probably* know the calculation to convert BTU output to real temperature increase vs ambient, and from there we can approximate a fan's duty cycle.

Alternatively, we could run it open backed and hope for the best short term?

I actually think a bigger concern is power input - 1x 13A plug isn't going to be very useful in terms of current for running equipment, and I would be concerned about running from multiple 13A inputs on the same ring/spur. 
3120VA isn't that much, and in terms of heat output is pretty low too - my server potentially draws 750W. 2-3 of them and we're stuffed! 

I wonder if we can stick it in the comms room, terminate the fibre there and more... 

We should also look at how this is funded - it's going to drive power use up, and I'd rather not squeeze the space out of cash accidentally. 
If we assume that a server is running idle at 200W or so, with an average UK electricity cost of 15.5p/ kWh then we can estimate that:

15.5 pence * (200W/1000W) * 24h * 365 days == £271.60 / 12 == £22.63/mo. 
That's more than a membership to keep something alive, potentially?

&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; * can we do something about the noise?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Noise can probably be managed by distance from us if we're spreading further wide, or asking nicely if we can put it in a cupboard and playing around in the comms room. We might want to look at consolodating all the noisy/dirty equipment in one corner.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We had a split in the old space of noisy/dirty and clean/social. Both
</I>&gt;<i> spaces ended up dirty.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If we're going to have a server rack we *need* to keep it clean. It
</I>&gt;<i> should not get lumped in with a dirty workshop.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I guess this probably wasn't what you meant but I want to be clear on this.
</I>
Let's put it right beside some really dusty, dirty equipment. I see no issues with this.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; I think I would first want to see answers to the 4 questions above. If
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; you just wanted to get the rack and put your server in it, fine, but if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; you want to also start building this out and see it more as a service
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; for hackerspace members, that is going to need more forward planning.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Definitely needs forward planning. I don't just want to buy, beg, borrow or steal stuff and end up with hardware we don't know what to do with in 6 months time. This is part of my idea about a 21U rack - it's a bit more convenient to move and live with in a smaller location than a full height rack, but it straps us for expansion... But then, are we beginning to get into the business of offering members COLO at that point?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think this is not a terrible idea, and would be useful to members. I
</I>&gt;<i> would invest time in getting a decent network set up to support members
</I>&gt;<i> colo.
</I>
Yeah, I think it could be a fun challenge. I wonder how happy our internet sponsor would be with us offering this service on their lines? 

Alternatively, I wonder if we could ask IFB or someone for some physical space and do *actual* colo at their location? Cheeky, but it could be worth it...
