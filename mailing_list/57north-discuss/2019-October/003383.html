<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> I know we’ve got a couple of racks in space already, but I’d like to gather thoughts and ideas on consolidating all the hardware into a single 21U or 42U rack,

I believe we now have the space for this. Considerations remaining are:

* how long will we have the space for this?
* do we have power for this?
* do we have cooling for this?
* can we do something about the noise?

&gt;<i> I’ve got an HP server that I’d really like to take out it’s current location and set up in space as a shared VM resource. I’m interested in building a networking and VM lab that I, and others, can tinker with. The server’s too deep for our current racks - it really needs a 1000mm deep unit.
</I>
1000mm deep sounds good.

&gt;<i> This should let us mount our router, core switch and servers as required in a single place.
</I>
Ok. We should plan this out, we might end up still with a need for two
racks if we're going to have distribution to the wall ports. The current
space router is also a GPS-powered NTP server, and an APRS IGate, it
won't benefit from being enclosed in a metal box.

&gt;<i> Is this something we can ask around the local community for do you think? Does anyone have any good starting points? I think the rack we used to have was 800mm deep, I’m not sure that’s a good starting point!
</I>
I think I would first want to see answers to the 4 questions above. If
you just wanted to get the rack and put your server in it, fine, but if
you want to also start building this out and see it more as a service
for hackerspace members, that is going to need more forward planning.

Thanks,
Iain.
