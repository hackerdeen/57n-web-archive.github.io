</I>&gt;<i> Subject: Your BitFolk VPSes (&quot;finzean&quot;, &quot;garioch&quot;) need to be rebooted 
</I>&gt;<i> for critical maintenance
</I>&gt;<i> Date: Wednesday, 23 October 2019 21:08
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Dear customer,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We've recently been made aware of some serious security issues in the
</I>&gt;<i> hypervisor software that we use (Xen). Fixing these problems will
</I>&gt;<i> require us to reboot our hosts and therefore all customer VPSes must
</I>&gt;<i> also be rebooted (or experience suspend/restore - see below).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You do not need to respond to this email unless:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> - you have questions about the process
</I>&gt;<i> - you wish to request monitoring of your VPS and its services
</I>&gt;<i> - you wish to have your VPS moved ahead of the scheduled time
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We must apply these fixes to ensure the security and reliability both of
</I>&gt;<i> your VPSes and of our infrastructure, which is why we have no choice but
</I>&gt;<i> to proceed with this work in the short period of time between
</I>&gt;<i> notification and the end of the embargo.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I understand that this will prove disruptive to you and that you would
</I>&gt;<i> prefer much more notice. When it comes to our own maintenance we do
</I>&gt;<i> generally provide more notice, but as this is an upstream security issue
</I>&gt;<i> with an embargo date it does mean that we need to reboot everything
</I>&gt;<i> before the embargo on the details ends (12:00Z 31 October 2019).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Your VPSes have been assigned a maintenance window during which the
</I>&gt;<i> reboots will take place. The start of the maintenance window for each of
</I>&gt;<i> your VPSes is listed below, in UTC time zone. Each maintenance window is
</I>&gt;<i> up to 60 minutes long, though the work should be completed much sooner
</I>&gt;<i> than this, typically within a few minutes (yay, SSDs!).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> +-----------------+---------------+--------------------+
</I>&gt;<i> | Name            | Main IPv4     | Window start (UTC) |
</I>&gt;<i> +-----------------+---------------+--------------------+
</I>&gt;<i> |         finzean | 85.119.82.172 | 2019-10-30 00:30   |
</I>&gt;<i> |         garioch | 85.119.84.59  | 2019-10-30 01:30   |
</I>&gt;<i> +-----------------+---------------+--------------------+
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> At some point in each maintenance window your VPS will be cleanly shut
</I>&gt;<i> down. The host it is on will then be patched and rebooted, and then your
</I>&gt;<i> VPS will be brought up again.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> You should ensure that your VPS and all its services start up correctly
</I>&gt;<i> on boot. We offer a free monitoring service which can help you to know
</I>&gt;<i> if your VPS and its services are working correctly. If you have not done
</I>&gt;<i> so already then you may want to get in touch with us to have this set
</I>&gt;<i> up. You can do that by replying to this email and describing which
</I>&gt;<i> services you would like monitored.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you would prefer for us to attempt to suspend and restore your VPS
</I>&gt;<i> to/from storage, resulting in less disruption, then you can indicate
</I>&gt;<i> that preference on our web panel at:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     <A HREF="https://panel.bitfolk.com/account/config/#prefs">https://panel.bitfolk.com/account/config/#prefs</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Doing so will cause us to add ping checks for your VPS so we can have a
</I>&gt;<i> good chance at knowing if the restore was successful.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If the assigned maintenance window is problematic for you, we can move
</I>&gt;<i> your VPS to already-patched hardware at some other time in advance of
</I>&gt;<i> your assigned maintenance window. This will still require us to shutdown
</I>&gt;<i> and then boot your VPS. If you'd like us to do that, please reply to
</I>&gt;<i> this email to say so.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you have any questions please reply to this email, which will open a
</I>&gt;<i> support ticket. There is no need to reply to this email unless you have
</I>&gt;<i> further questions, wish to request monitoring, or need your VPS moving
</I>&gt;<i> before the assigned window.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Best regards,
</I>&gt;<i> Andy Smith
