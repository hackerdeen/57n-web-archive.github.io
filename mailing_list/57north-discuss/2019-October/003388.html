<PRE>Hi,

This is probably the biggest thing to sort out.

&gt;&gt;<i> * do we have power for this?
</I>&gt;<i> We should probably wait until we get our first power bill and find out how much a kWh is, and then we can plan accordingly
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * do we have cooling for this?
</I>&gt;<i> Aircon in the room. In terms of cabinet-mount cooling, some thermostaticaly controlled fans if we're doing it properly?
</I>
Are we going to run the aircon all the time? What happens when someone
switches it off?

&gt;&gt;<i> * can we do something about the noise?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Noise can probably be managed by distance from us if we're spreading further wide, or asking nicely if we can put it in a cupboard and playing around in the comms room. We might want to look at consolodating all the noisy/dirty equipment in one corner.
</I>
We had a split in the old space of noisy/dirty and clean/social. Both
spaces ended up dirty.

If we're going to have a server rack we *need* to keep it clean. It
should not get lumped in with a dirty workshop.

I guess this probably wasn't what you meant but I want to be clear on this.

&gt;&gt;<i> I think I would first want to see answers to the 4 questions above. If
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you just wanted to get the rack and put your server in it, fine, but if
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> you want to also start building this out and see it more as a service
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for hackerspace members, that is going to need more forward planning.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Definitely needs forward planning. I don't just want to buy, beg, borrow or steal stuff and end up with hardware we don't know what to do with in 6 months time. This is part of my idea about a 21U rack - it's a bit more convenient to move and live with in a smaller location than a full height rack, but it straps us for expansion... But then, are we beginning to get into the business of offering members COLO at that point?
</I>
I think this is not a terrible idea, and would be useful to members. I
would invest time in getting a decent network set up to support members
colo.

Thanks,
Iain.
