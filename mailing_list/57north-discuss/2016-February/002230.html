<PRE>Hiya

Thanks for the email overview, great to have a synopses from the board re
this subject.  After the various chats about it in the space, I guess I'd
been thinking it over, so good to have a thread to add comments to.

The space sounds good generally.  Just to check, is it half a room, on the
first floor, or a room that occupies half of the first floor?  I guess the
later, but just to check.  It sounds like access and accessibility are
better, so that's cool.  I suppose if there are still stairs it's not
really accessible, but better than where we are, so that's cool.

Has anyone got any photos of the space?  It'd be good to see if it looks /
feels better.

The cost thing is, to my mind, the major downside. It'd be a shame if
moving put the longer term financial viability of 57n at risk.  I guess
there is maybe value in discussing how to increase membership and/or
income, but that is maybe one for a separate thread.  I think there are few
option that could maybe be explored re this.

I suppose, re moving the space, would there be any other comparative
options worth looking into?  Either other premises or options of sharing
existing spaces like the Anatomy Rooms, Peacocks or 17.  I guess The
Anatomy Rooms might be a good new option, the later two are well known,
obviously.  There is also the Creative Spaces program, that might provide
space or funds

.   Happy to help re investigating any of these options, if that'd be
useful, let me know.

Re moving and setting up, totally happy to help with this.  We've a people
carrier that, with all the seats down somewhat resembles a van, so that
could be put to use for the move.  So hand a up here for point b.

So, that's kinda my thoughts, hope that's helpful :)

Cheers

Andy

&gt;<i> Apologies all - the previous email has a subject borrowed from my much
</I>&gt;<i> longer, rough draft. This one is much less terrible -  please consider
</I>&gt;<i> commenting, we value your input!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Sent on behalf of the 57North Board of Directors*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Dear 57N members, visitors and followers
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As you may know, your directors have been collecting options around moving
</I>&gt;<i> to a
</I>&gt;<i> larger space. Our limiting factor has been our relatively low income in a
</I>&gt;<i> pretty expensive city. Recently, we've been looking into a local unit
</I>&gt;<i> (half a
</I>&gt;<i> large room) on George Street above the Eco Hub shop.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * The good parts:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     - The unit itself is half a first floor room, roughly the same floor
</I>&gt;<i> area
</I>&gt;<i>       as our present space but with more height (good for taller storage).
</I>&gt;<i> It
</I>&gt;<i>       is up a single flight of stairs via a corridor with space for
</I>&gt;<i> lockers.
</I>&gt;<i>       The unit's rear door leads up from a car park, available after 6pm.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     - The landlord does not require a deposit and is keen to help and work
</I>&gt;<i>       alongside a group such like us. He has a number of small projects
</I>&gt;<i> ideas
</I>&gt;<i>       he would offer, with kit, to anyone interested e.g. lighting showroom
</I>&gt;<i>       design, product prototyping and experimenting with fuel cells.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     - At this location we'd have control of the outside door so we'd have
</I>&gt;<i> actual
</I>&gt;<i>       24/7 access to the space.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * The less good parts:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     - The unit/room requires us to refit it. We would need to add:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         * more power sockets
</I>&gt;<i>         * network sockets
</I>&gt;<i>         * storage
</I>&gt;<i>         * desks
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>       This would have to be done with space volunteers
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     - We might have to start paying for internet connection, we cannot
</I>&gt;<i> assume
</I>&gt;<i>       our current sponsor will transfer our account. We are looking into
</I>&gt;<i> this
</I>&gt;<i>       but safer to assume we will lose this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     - The unit is more expensive to rent and the rate will increase as time
</I>&gt;<i>       goes on.  It is an extra &#163;45 per month initially compared to our
</I>&gt;<i> current rate and
</I>&gt;<i>       increases by &#163;70 ontop in 6 months, then by another &#163;50 ontop of
</I>&gt;<i> that nearer to
</I>&gt;<i>       2018. This does not include any utilities.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We are only just about meeting our present costs, therefore we would need
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> significantly increase our income prior to moving and have to maintain it
</I>&gt;<i> once
</I>&gt;<i> we move.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The directors propose we should only consider such a move if we can:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     (a) increase our income by an additional &#163;120/month on top of the
</I>&gt;<i> current,
</I>&gt;<i>         which will provide us with enough income for approx. 7 months
</I>&gt;<i> under new
</I>&gt;<i>         space rent/electric/internet
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     (b) gather enough interest from members to actually perform the move.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Addressing (a), one proposal is to ask members for sustained monthly
</I>&gt;<i> pledges on
</I>&gt;<i> top of their usual rate over the next 7 month period totalling &#163;120/month
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> additional income. Meeting this for the next 7 months would give us
</I>&gt;<i> breathing
</I>&gt;<i> room to increase membership and reach for funding.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For point (b), we suggest a separate show of hands for people who can
</I>&gt;<i> commit time, tools, transport and possibly money for materials. It would be
</I>&gt;<i> a great group project for those that are keen.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Comments only please at this stage. If we proceed, we'll arrange for
</I>&gt;<i> pledges to
</I>&gt;<i> received privately. Please either reply to this email or contact the
</I>&gt;<i> directors
</I>&gt;<i> directly with comments and feedback, using the email below.
</I>&gt;<i>
