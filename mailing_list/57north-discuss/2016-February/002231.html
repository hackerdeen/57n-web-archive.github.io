<PRE>Hey all

I am hosting a build-something weekend at my place in Cove bay, starting
Fri eve, for anyone who might be bored. I have a few things I want to
build/finish, i.e. a shed stool from a small quantity of spare wood, fix
shed drawers, that dam space 3d printer + quadcopter crap. I am also
redoing a house dipole I am not happy with.

Since I'll be setting up my garden as a working area, I may as well open up
my tiny house and wee garden to any space-types who want to make/code
something also, inside or outside. I have a standing bench setup outside
under cover, a garden table + chairs, number of tools, fixings and
components plus a bench power supply and scope.

I have fibre internets, big telly, 2 lounge recliner couches (seating for
5), 2x 2person dinner tables (so 4 more chairs but space might be issue if
all in lounge), a small spare bedroom and a load of campbeds/sleeping
bags/camp chairs.  Hell, even tents in the tiny garden if you wanted to
rough it in the morning frost. Only catch is its a family residential area.

It's a pretty small place but charming in it's own way. Foodwise, I have a
box of very nice mi-goreng noodles + any food you'd maybe bring along to
cook up (I don't mind doing this if for the group - cheap white fish
especially). I have a bit of whisky/spirits/wine left over from Xmas, but
no beer. There's stuff to do other than hacking - those interested can
photowork amongst the seaweed and pebbles at the bay harbour. I could pop
to the gym and sign-in guests at the Altens hotel leisure suite if anyone
needs a sauna/steam/jacuzzi.

I have added a picture of the house from space, used for recent roof work.
You can use google maps to find me - est. 2 hours of careful searching.
Alternately you can email / IRC me and I'll give the address. I can take 2
cars parking-wise, on top of my own. There is a No3 bus from Guild street
that takes you to Cove for about &#163;2.50.

Cheers,
Nordin
