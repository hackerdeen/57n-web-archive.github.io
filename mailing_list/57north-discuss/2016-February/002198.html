<PRE>Hi Folks

I'm doing a talk at AberdeenPHP user group this Wednesday at 6:30.  I kinda
mention this semi reluctantly as doing talks, terrifies the bejesus out of
me and I sort of think the less people go then better :)  but... putting
that aside, I think (hope) it'll be a generally useful and interesting
talk.

Talks at the PHP user group are usually quite technical and PHPey, but this
should be more useful for a more general audience I think.

Nominally it is an introduction to Joomla for developers, but it'll cover a
broad range of stuff.  Some questions that it might answer are...
- What is Joomla?
- How might I build a semi-complex online system?
- How would I get started creating a online system?
- What are the best options for Open Source systems for various application?
- How does Joomla work?
- What can it do for me?
- How do you develop with Joomla?
- What is the best way to do x?
- What Leonard Cohen song to people usually sing at joomla conferences at
the end of the night?
...so if any of those are kinda things you're wondering about, come along :)

It's a pretty casual wee group.

If you're coming, best to register at

just so Danny knows how much Beer and Pizza we'll need.

More info on the PHP user group is at <A HREF="http://aberdeenphp.co.uk/">http://aberdeenphp.co.uk/</A> and
