Anything that requires more than phone numbers (which are duplicates of my &quot;little black book&quot;) on my phone isn't going to happen.

You understand bitcoin is a digital currency?

The next option is a laptop, honestly I have no idea how this particular
machine works. Or any of the bitcoin machines.

You probably just need a qr code, but without a computer you
control(smartphones are computers too) you won't be able to verify the
transaction has worked.
