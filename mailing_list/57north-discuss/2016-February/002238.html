This didn't go to the list originally. 

Bitcoin addresses (public keys, really). If someone wants to pay you, you show them a QR code of an address at which you can receive Bitcoin.
That would be the 34-hexadecimal digit strings that Electrum (I just chose a tool at random ; experimenting) generated 5 of when I went through it's set up. 5 strings for &quot;receiving&quot; and 3 for &quot;change&quot;. Use a QR code, or any other way of transmitting 34 hex-digits, up to and including RFC-1149 compatible Avian Carriers.I looked at QR codes for geological sample tracking. Decided that they wouldn't be worth the hassle. We'd still have to buggered around with specialist printers (polythene-dissolving oil-based mud was the &quot;next big thing&quot; at the time; did horrible things to skin too, unsurprisingly), So plain old graphite won out. Never actually had a need to use one. 
So, someone plugs one of my public keys, and amount, and the public key of an existing bitcoin into their application, and that spits out another public key which represents the transaction? 
Which still leaves the question of how the bitcoin gets split into the value of the transaction and the value of the change. How does that happen? I'll guess that it is something to do with the 3 &quot;change&quot; codes Electrum has generated. There are several other cryptographic code-like numbers associated with the account, including a master key (128 hex-digits), a series of plain-English words (about 36 hex-digits, I estimate) and a password which seems to be an Electrum-specific thing.&#160; Another guess is that the &quot;receiving&quot; and &quot;change&quot; codes, as well as the other cryptographic detritus can be derived from the master key?

Sheesh, it's a learning curve for paying a paper-accessing service. Put it's still a learning curve worth climbing. Whether it's worth the 20-odd quid for round-tripping to the ATM in Glasgow is a distinct question. Probably. The question of whether anyone in the group actually has practical experience (or for that matter, bitcoin for sale) remains open.

With Bitcoin, QR codes are just used for the Bitcoin addresses (public keys, really). If someone wants to pay you, you show them a QR code of an address at which you can receive Bitcoin. If you want to pay someone, you scan their QR code and send Bitcoin to that address.
