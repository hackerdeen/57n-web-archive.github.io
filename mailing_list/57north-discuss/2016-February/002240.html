<PRE>Hey folks,

To anyone arriving this glorious morning I'll be in the back so just rock
up - the door is open.

If poss, ping the list so people can gather .

If anyone needs address and I'm deep in sawdust, Tom or Andy might be able
to respond on my behalf.

Cheers,
Ed

&gt;<i> Hey all
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am hosting a build-something weekend at my place in Cove bay, starting
</I>&gt;<i> Fri eve, for anyone who might be bored. I have a few things I want to
</I>&gt;<i> build/finish, i.e. a shed stool from a small quantity of spare wood, fix
</I>&gt;<i> shed drawers, that dam space 3d printer + quadcopter crap. I am also
</I>&gt;<i> redoing a house dipole I am not happy with.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since I'll be setting up my garden as a working area, I may as well open
</I>&gt;<i> up my tiny house and wee garden to any space-types who want to make/code
</I>&gt;<i> something also, inside or outside. I have a standing bench setup outside
</I>&gt;<i> under cover, a garden table + chairs, number of tools, fixings and
</I>&gt;<i> components plus a bench power supply and scope.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have fibre internets, big telly, 2 lounge recliner couches (seating for
</I>&gt;<i> 5), 2x 2person dinner tables (so 4 more chairs but space might be issue if
</I>&gt;<i> all in lounge), a small spare bedroom and a load of campbeds/sleeping
</I>&gt;<i> bags/camp chairs.  Hell, even tents in the tiny garden if you wanted to
</I>&gt;<i> rough it in the morning frost. Only catch is its a family residential area.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's a pretty small place but charming in it's own way. Foodwise, I have a
</I>&gt;<i> box of very nice mi-goreng noodles + any food you'd maybe bring along to
</I>&gt;<i> cook up (I don't mind doing this if for the group - cheap white fish
</I>&gt;<i> especially). I have a bit of whisky/spirits/wine left over from Xmas, but
</I>&gt;<i> no beer. There's stuff to do other than hacking - those interested can
</I>&gt;<i> photowork amongst the seaweed and pebbles at the bay harbour. I could pop
</I>&gt;<i> to the gym and sign-in guests at the Altens hotel leisure suite if anyone
</I>&gt;<i> needs a sauna/steam/jacuzzi.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have added a picture of the house from space, used for recent roof work.
</I>&gt;<i> You can use google maps to find me - est. 2 hours of careful searching.
</I>&gt;<i> Alternately you can email / IRC me and I'll give the address. I can take 2
</I>&gt;<i> cars parking-wise, on top of my own. There is a No3 bus from Guild street
</I>&gt;<i> that takes you to Cove for about &#163;2.50.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Nordin
</I>&gt;<i>
