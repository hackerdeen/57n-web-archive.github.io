<PRE>Though I'm rarely in Aberdeen any more, I do still read the passing mails.
Many of you may have met the service &quot;sci-hub.io&quot;, which by various tricks allows access to a lot of published science papers without needing a major library access. Since most of the science in such papers is paid for from our tax $CURRENCY$, I don't feel particularly constrained about using it. (Besides, my professional society fees run to over &#163;200/year, a significant part of which goes to an Athens subscription.)
Good service, casting a light into the depths of academic publishing by it's contrast ; I feel that I should be paying my due.But they only record a &quot;Bitcoin account&quot; as a support method. Since we went through this with WikiLeaks, I understand why. But it does leave me with the problem of how to buy BitCoin in order to pay to them.
I wouldn't be surprised if other people had similar other problems, though the details may differ.
TTBOMK, the only way I can get BitCoin into the (currently empty) &quot;wallet&quot; which I set up a few days ago is to go down to an ATM on Sauchiehall St in Glasgow and buy some there. (Though quite how I'd then &quot;get&quot; them &quot;into&quot; my&quot;wallet&quot; I'm rather vague on. (how do you split a BitCoin, for example? for a bullion coin, I have a chisel, but for a bit coin, I'm less clear. )&#160;Are there &quot;cyber financiers&quot; out there? And is this potentially a topic for a Tuesday? I haz coinage and can travelz, but am not sure of an effective path to take. 
Also, should I kill two stones with one bird and get my (P)GPG(P) keys set up and validated at the same time? I've found both passports now, and offended enough people over the years to be recognised, if not exactly welcomed.

 This is rather late at this point, but anyway: it's Tuesday. That means
the space will be open for members and visitors this evening. There
should definitely be people around by 19:00. 

I'd normally ask anyone to reply to -discuss saying if they'll be along
and what plans they've got, but I'm not sure there's much point at this
stage. Feel free to ignore me though and raise a virtual hand if you're
coming.
