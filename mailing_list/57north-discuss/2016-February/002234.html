The current situation with academic papers is ridiculous. It seems to be
that firewalled paper just don't get read, no one is benefitting in this
scenario.

If you head to Glasgow to use a bitcoin atm there will probably be
either someone or some written material explaining how to use it.

It probably involves a smart phone app and a qr code.

&gt;<i> Also, should I kill two stones with one bird and get my (P)GPG(P) keys

</I>
Yes you should, joining the web of trust brings many benefits. Someone
might even know what they are (not me!).
