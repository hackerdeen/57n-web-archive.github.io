The current situation with academic papers is ridiculous. It seems to be
that firewalled paper just don't get read, no one is benefitting in this
scenario.
Publishing companies benefit, most egregiously Elsevier, though there are many others only slightly less egregious.
It probably involves a smart phone app and a qr code.
Not going to happen. I had my phone pick-pocketed only a few months ago. Anything that requires more than phone numbers (which are duplicates of my &quot;little black book&quot;) on my phone isn't going to happen. I appreciate &quot;smart phones for unimportant things like Twitter and the occasional 16x16 sudoku, but anything that involves finance simply is not going to happen on my phone. 

Money is something that happens at home, or in cash. Or at the cash machine.

If you head to Glasgow to use a bitcoin atm there will probably be
either someone or some written material explaining how to use it.

It probably involves a smart phone app and a qr code.

Yes you should, joining the web of trust brings many benefits. Someone
might even know what they are (not me!).
