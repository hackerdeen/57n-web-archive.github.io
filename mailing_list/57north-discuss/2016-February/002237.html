Anything that requires more than phone numbers (which are duplicates of my &quot;little black book&quot;) on my phone isn't going to happen.

With Bitcoin, QR codes are just used for the Bitcoin addresses (public keys, really). If someone wants to pay you, you show them a QR code of an address at which you can receive Bitcoin. If you want to pay someone, you scan their QR code and send Bitcoin to that address.
