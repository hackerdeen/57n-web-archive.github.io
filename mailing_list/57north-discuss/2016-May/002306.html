<PRE>I noticed today that the piMPD in the space was full - to make some
space I have deleted a selection of the music that was on it.

The criteria for what to delete was pretty vague but went along the
lines of folders using a lot of space that contained things I either
didn't like or didn't care about. 

There is now some space for people to put new music on it (or put back
something I deleted if you really wanted it), but there isn't a lot of
storage (37GiB) there so might be worth people tidying up what htey have
on there and rotating for new stuff.
