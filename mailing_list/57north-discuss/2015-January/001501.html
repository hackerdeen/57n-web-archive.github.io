I'd like the public facing things (main website and wiki (it has the
membership application procedure so I think has to be considered public
facing) ) to have certs trusted by as many people as possible. 

Right now I think that means buying a cert or certs for them. This might
change when the EFF stuff is available and we can revisit the issue
then.
