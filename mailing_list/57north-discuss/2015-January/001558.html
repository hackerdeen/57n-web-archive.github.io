<PRE>Gooooood morning nerds!

A few of us were in the space updating the layout of it last night,
following Tuesday's discussion.

The main change is that we've swapped the big rack for 2x24U racks, and
stuck a tabletop between them (this was more work than it first sounds).
The bookshelves have also moved across the room to beside the microwave.

This has bought us some more sitting-down workspace, but at the exchange
of a bit of storage space. I feel like there's more usable space, but
that could just be tingles due to exessive caffeine intake.

At the moment, we have all the metalwork from the rack awaiting WSPR's
decision about its future within the next month. Once that's gone, we
can neaten up wiring and shift things about so that we've got some more
organised storage space.  Radio corner needs tidied &amp; cleaned (that's
irl's project for tonight) as do the two standing desks to recover
working space and keep it healthy! We should look under the standing
desks and review what we really need - there's some stuff that I've
never seen used!

We did lots of tidying, cleaning and throwing out of rubbish - the area
beside the microwave is now void of 3/4 empty 2L bottles, almost all the
plastic cups have been washed in the sink, the old &quot;bar&quot; has been
emptied of old bottles of fruit wine... There was about 5 bin bags of
rubbish in the end!

With that in mind, can I ask everyone to remember that this is a shared
space and it's everyone's responsibility to keep it clean &amp; tidy -
washing glasses, taking bin bags and boxes away, disposing of food
packing appropriately. We should probably mop the floor more, too - it's
pretty grotty! There's flash surface cleaner and paper towels to keep
surfaces clean.

The vortex is overdue a clean out. We've got less space for storing dead
computers and electronics at the moment, so we need to start
prioritising, tidying and appropriately disposing of what's there!

Hope you like what you see when you arrive in space next :)
