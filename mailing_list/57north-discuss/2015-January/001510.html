<PRE>Hi Rob,

Indeed, although the management account to which this is linked at OVH has
only this server on it.

</I>
If it is to be moved, it should be moved for a good reason, not a bad
reason. That is, it should be moved because we have a machine that is under
space control but *also* has the specs to run it.

In the future I have plans of integrating other space services into the
wiki, like Redmine, through the RDF backend. This doesn't necessitate these
applications running on the same machine however.

&gt;<i> From the discussion on IRC it looks like the new wiki requires more
</I>&gt;<i> resources to run than are available on the current space VPS. 
</I>
Yes, RDF is known to not be very resource friendly.

&gt;<i> Iain, could you tell us what spec is needed? 
</I>
With the current number of pages on the wiki, 192MB of RAM is required to
hold the full triplestore. This will grow as the wiki does, but I do not see
it using more than 2GB for at least a year. Obviously, allow extra RAM for
the OS and stuff. I would recommend at least 2 cores being available for the
wiki if you want it to be as responsive as it currently is.

&gt;<i> Is it possible to have a lower spec machine doing the web serving and
</I>&gt;<i> separate that from the heavy lifting, or is the heavy lifting in the
</I>&gt;<i> serving up pages part of things? 
</I>
Theoretically they are seperate tasks, although I would have no idea how to
seperate them and that would probably be more hassle than it is worth.

As far as I know the space currently has no procedures for securely managing
credentials. Our Bitfolk VPS is registered to me, although others have root
SSH access. HackHub still runs on a VPS that is owned by a non-member and
we're not even sure what country he's in and we rely on him to continue
paying for that on a monthly basis. I also don't believe that the space can
afford to pay &#163;36/month (I looked it up now) for the rental of hackr and
there will be more services appearing over the next year.

Thanks,
Iain.
