<PRE>Hello Hackers,

I have always felt uncomfortable with the camera being on all the time in the
space. Coming from CCC and Germany I think we are too forgiving with constant
surveillance in this country.

I cannot see any benefit to the camera, but I can think of two possible
arguments for it:

	1. It provides security 
	2. It allows those in the know to see who is in the space
	

Point 1 has two flaws; It only provides security after the fact(we can see who
wronged us) and the security it provides can be easily mitigated(in the last
break in the camera was disabled straight away).

In addition, images from the camera probably wouldn't be useful to the police.
Having reviewed footage from cameras on Union Street after the last break in,
they were not very helpful. I had no chance of making a positive ID based off
the footage.

In regards to Point 2. The current camera shows a fuzzy view of half the room.
Anyone peering in to see how many people are in the space would be better off
jumping in IRC or calling the space phone. That way they would know if they how
long they would have company.

To this point we haven't had anyone in the space that has had a problem with
the camera yet, or if they did have a problem, they didn't know the camera was
there.  We WILL loose potential members due to their discomfort with the
constant surveillance in the hackerspace.

I urge us to get rid of this camera as soon as possible.
