<PRE>Mornin All

Just reading through all this, I wasn't on IRC yesterday as I had a lot of
work on and that, for me, can be a mutually exclusive with IRC :)

Totally agree with Rob on things we depend on being under the control of
one individual.  Makes us kind of dependent on folk not getting mowed down
by crazy taxis drivers, busses etc.  Iain, that's cool if it is the only
thing on that account, perhaps you could share the log-in with a board
member.

I guess on the same note we should move stuff off hackerdeen.org onto the
same server as everything else.

If we did want a new central VPS, I use Linode, and they are pretty
awesome.  Probably the basic VPS would do, at least initially, and that'd
be &#163;6.64 p/m, see <A HREF="https://www.linode.com/pricing">https://www.linode.com/pricing</A> .  It's really fast, you
can put any OS on it you like and it all just works nicely.

I'm afraid I can't make the wiki day as the missus is working so I'll be
down with the kids. I could bring em along, but that'd probably not be
helpful :)

Cheers

Andy

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; To bring folks who weren't paying attention to IRC when we discussed
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this up to speed: this is currently hosted on hackr which is Iain's
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; dedicated server.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Indeed, although the management account to which this is linked at OVH has
</I>&gt;<i> only this server on it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm not comfortable with space infrastructure being hosting on
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; machines under the sole control of one member. I think it should be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; hosted somewhere under the control of the space generally to protect
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; against it disappearing if the member doesn't want to host it anymore
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; or becomes unavailable. I'm especially uncomfortable if we're going to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be using this as the main public facing site for the space.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If it is to be moved, it should be moved for a good reason, not a bad
</I>&gt;<i> reason. That is, it should be moved because we have a machine that is under
</I>&gt;<i> space control but *also* has the specs to run it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the future I have plans of integrating other space services into the
</I>&gt;<i> wiki, like Redmine, through the RDF backend. This doesn't necessitate these
</I>&gt;<i> applications running on the same machine however.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; From the discussion on IRC it looks like the new wiki requires more
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; resources to run than are available on the current space VPS.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, RDF is known to not be very resource friendly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Iain, could you tell us what spec is needed?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With the current number of pages on the wiki, 192MB of RAM is required to
</I>&gt;<i> hold the full triplestore. This will grow as the wiki does, but I do not
</I>&gt;<i> see
</I>&gt;<i> it using more than 2GB for at least a year. Obviously, allow extra RAM for
</I>&gt;<i> the OS and stuff. I would recommend at least 2 cores being available for
</I>&gt;<i> the
</I>&gt;<i> wiki if you want it to be as responsive as it currently is.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Is it possible to have a lower spec machine doing the web serving and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; separate that from the heavy lifting, or is the heavy lifting in the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; serving up pages part of things?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Theoretically they are seperate tasks, although I would have no idea how to
</I>&gt;<i> seperate them and that would probably be more hassle than it is worth.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As far as I know the space currently has no procedures for securely
</I>&gt;<i> managing
</I>&gt;<i> credentials. Our Bitfolk VPS is registered to me, although others have root
</I>&gt;<i> SSH access. HackHub still runs on a VPS that is owned by a non-member and
</I>&gt;<i> we're not even sure what country he's in and we rely on him to continue
</I>&gt;<i> paying for that on a monthly basis. I also don't believe that the space can
</I>&gt;<i> afford to pay &#163;36/month (I looked it up now) for the rental of hackr and
</I>&gt;<i> there will be more services appearing over the next year.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i> Iain.
