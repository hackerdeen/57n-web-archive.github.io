<PRE>I'm just going to follow up here with a little bit more information
about why chaosvpn is cool and fun and worth our time and effort.

Here's the main info page:
<A HREF="http://wiki.hamburg.ccc.de/ChaosVPN">http://wiki.hamburg.ccc.de/ChaosVPN</A>

ChaosVPN is a method for connecting hackers and hackerspaces in a
network that has shared resources and items of interest. It's run by the
CCC - <A HREF="http://ccc.de/,">http://ccc.de/,</A> who ran 31C3, the conference some of us are just
back from. 

It runs using a VPN called tinc - www.tinc-vpn.org. This is a really
cool bit of software - you define your VPN by its endpoints, not the
tunnels. Tinc will automatically mesh the network for you in a lovely
distributed, peer to peer manner to keep unnecessary connections and
latency low and security high. 

ChaosVPN has a number of services that are quite cool - internal
asterisk for communication, connection to irc servers &amp; jabber, minecraft,
usenet, ftp, *.hack domains and more.
For example: If we were running an interesting lecture, other hackers
could potentially dial in and listen or interact and ask questions.

I've connected my laptop and had a play and really enjoyed it - it's
been pretty interesting to learn about and interact with. I've got plans
on running a couple of services - GNUSocial and an Openttd server if
nothing else, again because I'm interested in seeing how like minded
people around the world play with toys I like.  As more people and
spaces join, more shared services appear!

By integrating the space network into ChaosVPN as has been proposed, we
give people automatic access to these toys if they choose to use them,
however if you choose not to then it won't have any major effects on
your day to day life.

If you're interested in learning more, then it's totally worth coming
along on the 18th. Even if you just want to understand what tinc is and
how you can use it for your own VPN!

Of course, all of this may be wrongi and I may have grabbed on to
entirely the wrong end of the stick, but if so we'll find out why on
the 18th!

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> After the workshop, there will also be discussions about possible services

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This event will start at 1pm although I may be in earlier than that to eat
