Yes, this is pretty much the setup I have at home, on an older system it
is also a micro but one of the last core-quads and I have debian dom0 with xen
and 3 domUs running comforably, one file server with samba, deluge
torrent client &amp; DNS, another which I can give friends accounts on, I
use that one for remote access and the third for testing. the dom0 has a
VDE bridge between it and the network card, so all the domUs go straight onto
the LAN. It runs prettty happily and I have not had any speed/memory
issues with it. I even stream HD movies from it.

Though I am away and we had a powercut, I don't think it is up, I need
to phone my brother to get it going again.

I have my arduino doorbot away with me and am working on it any chance I get,
But I think it will be into next month before I am ready.
