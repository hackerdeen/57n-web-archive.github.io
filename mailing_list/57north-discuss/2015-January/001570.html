<PRE>Hi,

Me and Hibby were busy today with lots of network upgrades. The wifi has not
yet been touched as the new wireless router was not available so that will
continue to work as it did previously but the wired network has been
upgraded and the support for the upgraded wifi is in place.

The wired network has been renumbered to fit into the ChaosVPN numbering
system. If you previously had a static address, it will no longer be in the
correct subnet. You can find a list of static addresses on the new wiki:

 <A HREF="https://wiki.57north.org.uk/index.php/Projects:Network/WiredLan">https://wiki.57north.org.uk/index.php/Projects:Network/WiredLan</A>

If you would like a static address for use on the space network, please
add this to the list on the wiki to avoid conflicts.

Static addresses for the synology, pimpd, mario and luigi have already been
setup and have been tested.

Currently it is not possible for devices on the wireless network to speak to
devices on the wired network (unless you are connecting via ChaosVPN). This
will be fixed once the wireless upgrades are complete.

IPv6 is now available again on the wired network, and will also be available
on the wireless network once the wireless upgrades are complete.

ChaosVPN and IPv6 both allow devices outside of the space to connect to your
computer if you have services running that bind to ports on external
interfaces. For this reason, we will be adding firewall rules to disallow
incoming connections from ChaosVPN in the DHCP pool ranges and all incoming
connections on IPv6. No firewall rules will be added for static addresses
although these can be added upon request.

If you have ideas for making our network even more awesome, then let's talk
about them and make them happen. Some things I have been thinking about
include IPX routing (maybe over ChaosVPN) for playing DOS games and playing
with protocols like 802.15.4 (low power personal area networks) or 802.15.7
(visual light communication).

Thanks,
Iain.
