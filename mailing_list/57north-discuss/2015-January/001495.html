This is tantamount to suggesting that we have a freeze on soliciting new
memberships, on organising any public events, and on generally being a
public-facing entity, until Lets Encrypt becomes a thing, because of your
politics. That's a reasonably big deal, so you should probably seek
explicit approval from the current member base before implementing this.
