That is true. Fill up the disk and you can break virtually everything&#8230; I&#8217;ve done it to myself before.

&gt;<i> VMs are a nice way to keep things in a properly managed jail but I

</I>&gt;<i> hardware (usually USB devices for what we've been using up to now)
</I>&gt;<i> without giving access to all the devices which could let you break
</I>&gt;<i> (current) doorbot.
</I>
VirtualBox allows USB passthrough for selected devices, could that work? Maybe you could blacklist certain specific things.

&gt;<i> Basically, setting up stuff so that we can have &quot;playing&quot; on doorbot with
</I>&gt;<i> any confidence that such playing can't break door access is more faff
</I>&gt;<i> than I can be bothered with. I'd rather just use another machine that

</I>&gt;<i> set up jails of some description on doorbot and really wants to do
</I>&gt;<i> that I could probably be convinced to give you access to do it.   
</I>
I probably don&#8217;t have the motivation, and you&#8217;d never trust me after I started this debacle (with the best of intentions, mind you!).

I have an RPi sitting around, unloved. It could be donated (possibly with some limited strings) to the space as a thing to put toys on.

Thoughts?
