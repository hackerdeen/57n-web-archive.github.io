Sorry for the slow response, I'm slowly catching up on emails...

There is a lot you can do to mess up a machine without root
privileges if you can run arbitrary code. 

VMs are a nice way to keep things in a properly managed jail but I
haven't seen any VM tech that would have an easy way to give access to
hardware (usually USB devices for what we've been using up to now)
without giving access to all the devices which could let you break
(current) doorbot.

Basically, setting up stuff so that we can have &quot;playing&quot; on doorbot with
any confidence that such playing can't break door access is more faff
than I can be bothered with. I'd rather just use another machine that
we're not relying on for playing. If someone else has a sane plan to
set up jails of some description on doorbot and really wants to do
that I could probably be convinced to give you access to do it.
