<PRE>Hi Andy,

This is a temporary measure while we have discussion. I would not want
unencrypted access to the wiki to be the default in the long term.

&gt;<i>    I would probably use MediaWiki Bootstrapskin (

Bootstrap is a nice choice as many of us will already be familiar with it,
meaning it should be easier to write extensions to the wiki to provide any
functionality we find to be missing.

Thanks,
Iain.
