<PRE>Dear all

In mid-September the directors launched a survey to better understand the
general opinions of people involved in and around the space. Over the last
directors meeting, directors reviewed the feedback and started to take them
onboard.  Linked [1] is a summary of the survey responses.

On average, members appeared to agree that the space has grown an
effective social culture with like-minded people who lean towards an
acceptance of free expression. Feel free to disagree. Most respondents also
felt they get good value for their membership free.

That said, we do require discussions around areas highlighted
for improvement, such as inclusion, space utilisation and membership
levels. In particular, if you have an idea and a potential plan to
implement it, do pass it on to the group.

Cheers,
Ed
