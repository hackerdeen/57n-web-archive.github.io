<PRE>Hi Iain,

&gt;<i> On 7 Jan 2015, at 20:53, Iain R. Learmonth &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.57north.co/listinfo/57north-discuss">irl at fsfe.org</A>&gt; wrote:

</I>&gt;<i> On the 28th March 2014 we were issued, free of charge, a wildcard

</I>&gt;<i> certificates for Open Source projects programme. This is currently in use
</I>&gt;<i> for our website at <A HREF="https://57north.co/">https://57north.co/</A> although this certificate is not as

Yes, Android (especially older versions, I think?) is weird and lacks some root CAs, this plagues some other CAs too, but it&#8217;s an outlier. GlobalSign is still widely trusted. That&#8217;s better than not being trusted at all.

&gt;<i> As a free alternative, for new services like the new wiki announced last
</I>&gt;<i> night (expect an email about this shortly), I have been using CAcert
</I>&gt;<i> certificates. CAcert.org is a community-driven Certificate Authority that
</I>&gt;<i> issues certificates to the public at large for free.
</I>
They&#8217;re also not trusted by *anyone*. We&#8217;re not the CCC, we should use a CA actually trusted by people.

Also, Certificate Authorities are not terrorism, it&#8217;s okay to pay the whole Five United States Dollars to obtain a widely-trusted certificate. CAs are a flawed system, but they&#8217;re not a broken, dishonest or malicious one. I don&#8217;t see why we shouldn&#8217;t pay for a proper certificate if needs be.

I feel the same as Shell here. Though I haven&#8217;t attended any recent space meetings, so my opinion hardly counts.

Thanks!
