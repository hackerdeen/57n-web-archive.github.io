<PRE>Hi,

A lot of the new systems appearing are being based on the space LDAP
accounts.

If you do not currently have an LDAP account, but I have your GPG key, ping
me an email with the subject line &quot;Space LDAP Account&quot; and I can email you a
password.

If I don't have your GPG key but you will be at the space tomorrow, I can
set you up with an account then.

It's not necessary to have an LDAP account to be a member but it is
necessary to be a member to have an LDAP account. You will still be able to
connect to the space wifi without an account but you may find that you're
missing out on a few things if you do not have an account.

If you have an account on hackr and an LDAP account, these accounts will be
merged later this week. If you did not previously have an account on hackr
but you have an LDAP account, you will have an account on hackr later this
week using your LDAP credentials. If you have an account on hackr but do not
have an LDAP account, your account will remain as it currently is and I will
contact you to arrange the creation of an LDAP account.

Thanks,
Iain.
