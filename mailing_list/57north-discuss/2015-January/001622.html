I wasn't organised enough to submit these to the agenda proper but
there are a couple of other things I think we should discuss. 

* Venue for decision making

Where/how should &quot;the space&quot; be making decisions?

Discussion and decision making has been happening across a variety of
venues (in person in the space, on IRC, on the mailing list(s), ...)
and we don't have an authoritative venue. The most egregious case of
this split I've seen recently was a fortnight ago those of us who
happened to be in the space discussed a range of things and &quot;decided&quot;
how we should proceed on them (and then later on the issue of
where/how the wiki should be hosted Iain and I talked some more and
&quot;decided&quot; on a different approach). Much of the things discussed that
evening had been previously discussed on the mailing list but there
was no update to that discussion to reflect what was discussed/decided
in person.

I'd propose that this mailing list be the authoritative venue for
discussion and decision making should be via consensus here. I
wouldn't intend this to preclude discussion happening elsewhere (the
whole point is that we have a physical space so I would expect
discussion to happen there, and often when people are disagreeing on a
mailing list it can be sorted out in short order face to face) but
would like to see that when discussions happen elsewhere the outcome
of that is copied back to the mailing list (and where possible that
the discussion is going to happen is announced here). 

I think the mailing list is the best choice for the authoritative venue
as it gives the best inclusivity by allowing people to participate as
and when they have time to respond to email rather than requiring
presence at a particular time and location. 

* Financial reporting

Ed has much data tracking our financial transactions. I propose that
he starts publishing monthly summaries of incoming, outgoing and
balance. 

I've half a mind to propose that all our financial records should be
public, but I stop short of that as it would disclose who has/hasn't
paid their membership dues (if that isn't going to be public we should
have a discussion of who does/should have access to that data).
