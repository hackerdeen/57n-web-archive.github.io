Cool this sounds like a useful solution to two of our problems. We get rid of
the unmaintained site and we won't need a wildcard ssl. There isn't anything
else in our infrastructure that needs to be user facing. The quotesdb is
probably a bad idea.

Would someone like to volunteer to waste money on a scam cert for the three
months until the EFF positivity kicks in?

</I>
I would prefer it to look like a static text file, I imagine I am in the
minority.
