<PRE>Hi all,
As I'll soon be skipping the country, I'm having a bit of a clear-out.

Needing a good home is my trusty IBM workstation. It's a few years old now
(mid-2006 according to the sticker), but it was used until quite recently
for crunching geoscience data within &quot;a big oil company&quot;, and is still a
surprisingly capable machine.

It's a dual-opteron (8 core?) Intellistation A with 16gb RAM. I'll be
removing the hard drives, but it has room for at least 4 internally, as
well as 2 optical drives and plenty of card slots. The video board is a
dual-head Nvidea Quattro - I'm not sure of the exact version, but
presumably a fairly high-end card at the time it was produced given what it
was used for.

It's worth pointing out that it's not your typical PC World desktop - it's
built like a brick (it's big and heavy!), and the fan noise can be quite
loud, especially on start-up.

If anyone's interested, let me know and I'll bring it along on Tuesday. It
can be yours in return for a small donation to the space.

Cheers,
Calum
