I won't object to installing such certs if this is what we decide, but I
would object to the space paying for such certs.

As a compromise, I would be willing to have unencrypted by default until the
EFF CA is ready. But as soon as passwords are concerned, require SSL. I
could also put together some text that easily explains to people how to
install the CAcert root certificates.

How does this sound?

Thanks,
Iain.
