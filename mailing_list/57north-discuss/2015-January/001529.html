<PRE>Sorry for not getting back to this sooner. Work and drinking beer seem
to have consumed all my time for the past few days.

Resource issues:

</I>&gt;<i>     where resource limits are reached would not be insignificant.
</I>&gt;<i>   * We have had issues when uploading high resolution images to the

</I>&gt;<i>     image thumbnailing, so resources need to be allowed for this.
</I>
We can get more resources. EIther upgrading garioch or getting another
server. Andy's link to Linode put the cost of that at $10/month for the
spec you said was currently needed, possibly rising to $20/month as the
wiki grows. 

I think we should pay that to keep the wiki under space control if we do
decide to use semantic mediawiki.

Security issues:
&gt;<i>   * Semantic MediaWiki is a complex PHP application and as such will,
</I>&gt;<i>     from time to time, have remotely exploitable vulnerabilities.
</I>&gt;<i>   * garioch currently hosts our mail and DNS systems. These, if
</I>&gt;<i>     compromised, have far greater potential for causing reputational
</I>&gt;<i>     harm than the wiki.
</I>&gt;<i>   * As far as possible, we should also be keeping membership data away
</I>&gt;<i>     from any potential security issues.
</I>
If the risk of compromise is this high I'd be more inclined towards not
using it.

&gt;<i>   * Currently, the space enjoys me paying for hackr. I pay for it and
</I>&gt;<i>     maintain it for the benefit of all space members.
</I>
I'm not sure what this is doing on this list? The wiki can't be moved
elsewhere because you're being generous?
