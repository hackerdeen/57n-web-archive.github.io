<PRE>Hey Robert,

&gt;<i> On 14 Jan 2015, at 01:35, Robert McWilliam &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.57north.co/listinfo/57north-discuss">rmcw at allmail.net</A>&gt; wrote:

I don&#8217;t think allowing access to doorbot is bad, allowing *sudo* access is. If it weren&#8217;t for sudo access, I wouldn&#8217;t have been able to do `sudo killall sshd`. (Again, I&#8217;m really sorry about that.)

&gt;<i> The previous permissive access to doorbot was because we were hosting

</I>
One option would just be to run all the toys in a VM on doorbot and give people access to the VM. It&#8217;d be slow, sure, but none of this stuff really needs to be ultra-fast, and if someone screws up, only the toys are lost.

Thoughts?
