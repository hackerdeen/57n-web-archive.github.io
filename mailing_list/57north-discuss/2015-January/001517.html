Hi, Robert.

I agree with you about that: I fear a 'gate-keeper' mentality emerging
in the space, and I don't like it. I joined to learn from other people
about new things and help people with the few things I do know about.
However, my heart sinks to my boots as I read these emails about who
controls what and how to stop the NSA/GCHQ/name-your-evil-agency crap.

What happened to our 'mission' to democratise information technology?

It seems to have been overwhelmed by a self-appointed rebel alliance
intent on defending us from ourselves. I'm fed up with it all and I'll
probably end up being dismembered because I'm not a fundamentalist...

&gt;<i> This is pretty much the same discussion we had when Calum offered
</I>&gt;<i> the rack we've currently got. Consensus then was that we wanted
</I>&gt;<i> infrastructure to be owned by the space to protect against it
</I>&gt;<i> being taken away again. I think the website is a more critical part
</I>&gt;<i> of our infrastructure than the rack and the chances of it
</I>&gt;<i> disappearing are much higher as it has to be paid for on an ongoing
</I>&gt;<i> basis.
</I>
It seemed like a good idea for the space to have a physical computing
infrastructure and, although the computers I originally donated didn't
work (and the ones from Petrotech were crap). I did buy more than &#163;500
of replacement PSU's and motherboards to fix them. I've given these to
Tom to build a cluster because the consensus seems to be that we don't
need or want any physical infrastructure unless someone else pays the
electricity bill. I think it's a pity and an opportunity lost because
just repairing computers is something of interest to many people.

&gt;<i> What is the objection to hosting it on garioch?
</I>
Where is &quot;garioch&quot; and how do we lesser mortals access it?

  Tony.
