Just to note that this doesn't need to be limited to directors. Any
member is welcome to attend, contributions from people other than the
directors is at the discretion of whoever is chairing but they have
been allowed before (when I was sticking my oar in before I was a
director) and I would imagine they will be again.

If any members have opinions on the things on the agenda, or would
like to raise anything else about the running of the space, please do
come along or let us know before the meeting.

The trouble with doing something right the first time, is nobody
appreciates how difficult it was.
