<PRE>&gt;<i> Yea, might be up for that.  were you thinking we might get a 57n team?
</I>I've not really thought it through as far as that. But that's a
possibility. Would it be ateam, a ragtag bunch, or a crack commando 
unit sent to military prison for a crime they didn't commit?

&gt;<i> It is the same route as parkrun, but with the start and end locations
</I>&gt;<i> swapped round, and half an hour later, could be a funny mix of punters.
</I>
I've never made it along to parkrun - I quite like my saturday in bed.

&gt;<i> I usually look like a twat running, so same as norm.  Often only person at
</I>&gt;<i> parkrun with no spandex and with a fishing hat or snowman earwarmers on,
</I>&gt;<i> running quite slowly and singing I am a terrorist, (DJ food v DK, Vadmin
</I>&gt;<i> remix, slow enough to run with, but hard not to sing along to).
</I>
What is this slow - you don't run to happy hardcore? I like to keep in
time with the DJ Cotts Aussie hardcore podcast. 180bpm crew for life.

At any point, has anyone ever noticed I mention my knees are unwell? I
can't possibly imagine why.
