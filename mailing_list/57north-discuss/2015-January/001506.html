<PRE>Hi Guys

Re Iain...

That sounds good, unencrypted by default until the EFF CA is ready.  This
would be a great short terms solution pending the even better long terms
solution.

Re Tom...

There is no reason why using bootstrap should mean it has to look like a
bootstrap site :) we could style it to look like a static text file, or
green fixed width text on black background.  Totally open minded on what it
could look like.  That said, an off-the-shelf thing is a good starting
point for getting going quickly.  So the one demoed at
<A HREF="http://www.mediawikibootstrapskin.co.uk/nexus/index.php?title=Main_Page">http://www.mediawikibootstrapskin.co.uk/nexus/index.php?title=Main_Page</A> is
perhaps as good as any, as a starting point.  From memory, there is an
option in MediaWiki for users to select a skin in their profile, so we
could have a variety and folk could choose whatever they like.

Cheers

Andy
