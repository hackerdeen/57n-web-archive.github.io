Sounds good.


&gt;<i> I think it is a really good idea. Last year we had a soldering workshop

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
We have badge boards and most of the components (would need battery holders
and batts) plus there is a barepaint version for the kids.

Other things I can think of:

- RTL-SDRs showing interesting things.. ADS-B/AIS .. so live planes/ship on
a map.
- EEG headset challenge (hopefully working this year)
- Michael's plasam speaker playing chip tunes perhaps (Awesome but risky?)
- Master Hibby's long light strip across the table perhaps?
- past workshop examples
- Dev board selection etc

+ more I am sure

Also I wonder if we can make those unpowered LED wrist bangles (from CCC)
that light up when near RFID signals.. they looks soo simple yet awesome
and carry a good message.

Cheers,
Ed
