<PRE>Hiya

I think issue may just be solved by the new semantic wiki.  The new wiki
looks great, and we'd discussed using this as our main website and CMS.  I
think this will be good as it'll mean we don't have duplicated info and
systems.  I'll happily white the MediaWiki skin, I can get stuck in and do
that next couple of week.  We can kind of make it look 'cool', and still be
a wiki I think.  Reason I mention that here is it perhaps solves this
perceived issue, as the wiki is accessible via http and https.

I would probably use MediaWiki Bootstrapskin (
<A HREF="http://www.mediawikibootstrapskin.co.uk/index.php?title=Main_Page">http://www.mediawikibootstrapskin.co.uk/index.php?title=Main_Page</A> ) as a
starting point, and do a bit of customising from there.

Cheers

Andy

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There was discussion last night regarding TLS certificates for 57North
</I>&gt;<i> services. In this email I will outline the current situation for TLS
</I>&gt;<i> certificates on our services, what I would like to see and also try to
</I>&gt;<i> outline some of the other opinions from last night (but I won't name anyone
</I>&gt;<i> in case I've misrepresented their view).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On the 28th March 2014 we were issued, free of charge, a wildcard
</I>&gt;<i> certificate for *.57north.co by GlobalSign as part of their free
</I>&gt;<i> certificates for Open Source projects programme. This is currently in use
</I>&gt;<i> for our website at <A HREF="https://57north.co/">https://57north.co/</A> although this certificate is not as
</I>&gt;<i> trusted as we were led to believe. I have often heard people complaining
</I>&gt;<i> that the certificate was not trusted, especially on Android devices.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Wildcard certificates, especially now that we have multiple servers running
</I>&gt;<i> our services, present security concerns in that any server would be able to
</I>&gt;<i> pretend to be any other. GlobalSign are not willing to renew this
</I>&gt;<i> certificate for free and it expires on the 29th March 2015.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As a free alternative, for new services like the new wiki announced last
</I>&gt;<i> night (expect an email about this shortly), I have been using CAcert
</I>&gt;<i> certificates. CAcert.org is a community-driven Certificate Authority that
</I>&gt;<i> issues certificates to the public at large for free.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Given that our current certificate is not that trusted, I don't see this as
</I>&gt;<i> introducing any new barriers to accessing our site. It was suggested that
</I>&gt;<i> we
</I>&gt;<i> have the wiki as not HTTPS-only and I have temporarily agreed to this, but
</I>&gt;<i> it is important to remember that encryption is not only there to protect
</I>&gt;<i> passwords. Encryption stops those who are spying on your connection from
</I>&gt;<i> seeing what projects you are looking at, what themes you're reading about,
</I>&gt;<i> etc. in the same way that when you go to a public library people can see
</I>&gt;<i> you
</I>&gt;<i> went to the library but not what books you have read. Reader privacy is
</I>&gt;<i> important and as a hackerspace, I believe, this is something we should be
</I>&gt;<i> promoting.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Don't forget that if we have unencrypted services because we're afraid
</I>&gt;<i> people may be put off by scary browser messages, the terrorists have won.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It was also proposed that for our primary public facing presence that we
</I>&gt;<i> used a paid certificate that was likely to be trusted in as many browsers
</I>&gt;<i> as
</I>&gt;<i> possible. I would object the hackerspace funding this browser-based
</I>&gt;<i> terrorism where there are only a select few that get to choose who can be
</I>&gt;<i> trusted on the Internet, and I would hope other members would object to
</I>&gt;<i> their membership fees being spent in that way too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am only proposing the use of CAcert certificates until EFF's Let's
</I>&gt;<i> Encrypt
</I>&gt;<i> is available for use. This would allow us to have browser trusted
</I>&gt;<i> certificates for free. You can learn more about this project in this video:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://media.ccc.de/browse/congress/2014/31c3_-_6397_-_en_-_saal_6_-_201412301400_-_let_s_encrypt_-_seth_schoen.html#video">http://media.ccc.de/browse/congress/2014/31c3_-_6397_-_en_-_saal_6_-_201412301400_-_let_s_encrypt_-_seth_schoen.html#video</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Of course, we are a community, and it is important to discuss these issues
</I>&gt;<i> where it is our public facing presence being affected, and so I am opening
</I>&gt;<i> this for discussion on the mailing list. Please reply to this thread with
</I>&gt;<i> your views on the issue and any proposals you might have for this issue.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for your attention,
</I>&gt;<i> Iain.
