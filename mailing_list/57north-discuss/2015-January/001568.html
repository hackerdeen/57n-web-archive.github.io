Yes although I don't know what the processor supports on doorbot my i7
laptop does support VTd which allows me to pass through PCI busses in
hardware to VMs I use this function with my work, My home machine also
supports this, but I had serious trouble getting to to work with xen,
with all kinds of hilarity.

&gt;<i> Nonetheless physical separation between production systems (especially

</I>&gt;<i> shouldn't be difficult to find alternative hardware to run a 'mucking

Agree and playing in a pi as Andrea suggests, is a good idea, because
what would be played with that can't be done on one.
