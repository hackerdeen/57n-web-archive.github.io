<PRE>I have restored SSH access to doorbot, but ATM only for me: I have
removed all other keys and changed the passwords. 

I don't think it is a good idea to restore access to the same &quot;anyone
who asks for it&quot; level we've been running with up to now. I'd suggest
all the directors should have access. I'd like to have the option of
adding more people if they want to help with the admin (similarly,  and
probably more importantly since they're likely to need more admining,
we could do with deciding who should have access to our other
systems). How about folks should ask/be nominated for access here and
we look for consensus that they can be trusting not to abuse or break
things? 

The previous permissive access to doorbot was because we were hosting
a number of &quot;toy&quot; applications there: the LED sign, text to speech
stuff, sensors, cards against hackspace, red alert and probably others
that I've forgotten. I liked that we had a machine to dump these on
and there was some nice collaboration as different people have updated
some of those apps. For the stuff where it was just a server hackr
would be a great alternative but some of it depends on being connected
to hardware in the space. I'd like to offer my previous laptop to be
set-up somewhere in the space to host these kind of apps. It's
reasonably powerful (about 3 year old i5) and idles at about 8W so
shouldn't cost much to run. 

It'll be a while before I'd have time to set it up with anything. If
someone else wants to volunteer to do it I'd be more than happy to
hand it off to them.
