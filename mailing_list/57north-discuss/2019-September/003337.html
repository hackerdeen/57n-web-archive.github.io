Dear all

We are arranging for a group visit to the Unit at Kettock Lodge,
Bridge of Don - a potential new location for the space [1]. The
building rep can be available to open from 7pm Tues and given our
schedule, we will aim for this date and time. We'll assemble at the
front entrance. Could I ask that anyone who wants to see the location
but cannot make Tuesday 7pm to please get in touch ASAP. I can take
some video and post it on the wiki, but the virtual tour is probably a
better option [2].

Also if transport is an issue, please contact the discuss maillist to
see if lifts are available.

Cheers,
Nordin.
