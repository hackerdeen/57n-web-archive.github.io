&gt;<i> Hi all
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On Tuesday, the board met and voted [1] to start our move to the
</I>&gt;<i> Kettock Lodge Bridge of Don location [2]. We plan to use October as
</I>&gt;<i> an overlap month, with access to both spaces whilst we move over.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Strategy
</I>&gt;<i> The current move strategy is to arrange for seating, tables and wifi
</I>&gt;<i> in the new space locations as soon as possible, arranging and
</I>&gt;<i> unboxing other items after. Items for trashing will be left behind and
</I>&gt;<i> disposed of in a separate effort.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When exactly?
</I>&gt;<i> To get a good start, we are arranging for the first physical kit move
</I>&gt;<i> to begin this Saturday (28th) using two vans, a standard Transit and
</I>&gt;<i> small Transit Connect, over a couple of runs. We will arrange follow-up
</I>&gt;<i> moving rounds after this first one as needed. Anyone who is able to
</I>&gt;<i> volunteer for this round should confirm via the discuss list; we'd need
</I>&gt;<i> people at both locations, so please email discuss if you could use a lift.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> ETA for Sat volunteers at the old location is approx. 10am. ETA for Sat
</I>&gt;<i> volunteers at new location is 1pm, as the first van-run arrives.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you cannot make this weekend but still like to be a part of the physical
</I>&gt;<i> move, we'll likely announce further moves. It is also expected that there
</I>&gt;<i> will be a few sorting evenings at the new location once items are moved.
</I>&gt;<i> Unlike over moves, we have a fair bit of open space we can use to sort
</I>&gt;<i> things out. We hope be able to confirm an official place-of-business
</I>&gt;<i> change over date after the weekend.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Coordination
</I>&gt;<i> Friday evening and Saturday morning have been suggested as times to
</I>&gt;<i> sort the space to get it ready for transport. I suggest that the
</I>&gt;<i> vehicle drivers
</I>&gt;<i> (or those they delegate to) take the lead in deciding what goes into vans
</I>&gt;<i> on Sat, as they'll know how much they can move at once. Beyond that,
</I>&gt;<i> we are looking to put as many things into labelled boxes as possible which
</I>&gt;<i> those attending can collaborate on. We have some folded boxes already
</I>&gt;<i> but if anyone has a source of strong boxes we can borrow or keep, do
</I>&gt;<i> email in.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Cheers,
</I>&gt;<i> Nordin
