<PRE>Hiya

Thanks Midder, great to have a thread to discuss this and get feedback and
thoughts.

I'd be keen to join for the viewing, be great to see the space.

This is probably a question for Tom, but looking at the PDF, it sounds like
it's the area noted as &quot;Suite H&quot; in the PDF, is that right do you think?

The car sharing scheme sounds good to me, I'd probably alternate between
cycling and driving, but if driving happy to do car sharing, and easy
enough to pick folk up on the way from here.

I suppose, to my mind, the main question is, how many people think that
moving temporarily to Bridge of Don would put them off being a member?

I've still been looking at places and adding them to the wiki page at
<A HREF="https://wiki.57north.org.uk/index.php/Possible_Future_Space">https://wiki.57north.org.uk/index.php/Possible_Future_Space</A> but there is
not much within our budget really.  Some great places at £500p/m, but for
under £400p/m there are few options.  The one I added yesterday, 278 George
St is a good example of that, good space and location, but £500p/m.

Cheers
Andy

</I>&gt;<i> Aberdeen.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We don't have long, so a decision should be made and we want all the

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One was members getting to the location, A few of us will be driving out
</I>&gt;<i> due to the location, so organisation of transport by car sharing can be
</I>&gt;<i> done, I'll probably be driving from Holburn street, and can take two
</I>&gt;<i> people, when I am around. Others may so the same.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Any thoughts on this are welcome, but we only have a couple of weeks left,

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am going to contact them an possibly arrange another viewing of the

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Hello Everyone.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Some of you may be aware of the building we are currently in being
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; available for all enquiries, this is due to, as far as we know, the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; property having been sold. There is also a rent increase which cannot
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; be met by our current membership and membership rate, It appears the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; landlord has an interest in the building being empty, either way, it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; may not be viable to stay.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The gaming cafe concern who we sublet from, soon to be called Reset
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Aberdeen, was also sold and they seem to be interested in moving.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This has been discussed by some of the membership, at the Openday and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; at other times. So what does this mean, and why should you be
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; interested?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; It means we are looking for a new location, so we would like to hear
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; from anyone who knows of a suitable location which we could use, if
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the property is too big for us we can also approach the gaming cafe,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; and potentially fill a space which we could both share.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; This will be a developing situation and we may not have a lot of time
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to arrange this, we have a rolling agreement till the end of
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; September, by which time we should ideally have found a suitable
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; location.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Any questions you may have, we will endeavour to answer, respond to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the discuss list, so anyone can see our discussion, or come in on a
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Tuesday.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; We have moved before and we can do it again, so this could be an
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; opportunity, to find an even better location for our community.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Mull this over while you enjoy the fine weather we are having.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;
