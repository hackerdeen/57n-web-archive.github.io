Hello Everyone,

An Update for the membership, On the openday last Tuesday, we were again discussing the space move, and Tom who had seen the space, put forward that we should aim to move into Kettock Lodge (<A HREF="https://aberdeeninnovationpark.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Innovation-Park-Kettock-Lodge-Brochure-Updated-August-2019.pdf">https://aberdeeninnovationpark.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Innovation-Park-Kettock-Lodge-Brochure-Updated-August-2019.pdf</A>) space at a temporary location, where it would buy us time to find a new location for the space, Kettock Lodge currently occupied buy Aberdeen Action on Disability (<A HREF="http://aad-online.com/">http://aad-online.com/</A>) we will be sharing space with them, but the space we will have is significantly larger then our current location, not in a cellar, but further away from the centre of Aberdeen.

We don't have long, so a decision should be made and we want all the member to raise any concerns.

One was members getting to the location, A few of us will be driving out due to the location, so organisation of transport by car sharing can be done, I'll probably be driving from Holburn street, and can take two people, when I am around. Others may so the same.

Any thoughts on this are welcome, but we only have a couple of weeks left, if everyone thinks this is acceptable this plan we will go ahead.

I am going to contact them an possibly arrange another viewing of the space, give me a shout if you are interested.

Midder.

</I>&gt;<i> Hello Everyone.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Some of you may be aware of the building we are currently in being
</I>&gt;<i> available for all enquiries, this is due to, as far as we know, the
</I>&gt;<i> property having been sold. There is also a rent increase which cannot
</I>&gt;<i> be met by our current membership and membership rate, It appears the
</I>&gt;<i> landlord has an interest in the building being empty, either way, it
</I>&gt;<i> may not be viable to stay.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The gaming cafe concern who we sublet from, soon to be called Reset
</I>&gt;<i> Aberdeen, was also sold and they seem to be interested in moving.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This has been discussed by some of the membership, at the Openday and
</I>&gt;<i> at other times. So what does this mean, and why should you be
</I>&gt;<i> interested?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It means we are looking for a new location, so we would like to hear
</I>&gt;<i> from anyone who knows of a suitable location which we could use, if
</I>&gt;<i> the property is too big for us we can also approach the gaming cafe,
</I>&gt;<i> and potentially fill a space which we could both share.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This will be a developing situation and we may not have a lot of time
</I>&gt;<i> to arrange this, we have a rolling agreement till the end of
</I>&gt;<i> September, by which time we should ideally have found a suitable
</I>&gt;<i> location.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Any questions you may have, we will endeavour to answer, respond to
</I>&gt;<i> the discuss list, so anyone can see our discussion, or come in on a
</I>&gt;<i> Tuesday.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We have moved before and we can do it again, so this could be an
</I>&gt;<i> opportunity, to find an even better location for our community.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Mull this over while you enjoy the fine weather we are having.
</I>&gt;<i>
