<PRE>Hi all,

The following is a provisional timeline for the migration of the space
network:

25th September - Begin teardown, leaving wifi and doorbot
27th September - Equipment is configured for new location
28th September - Begin deployment at new location
1st October - Wifi available, limited wired connectivity

After today, you should expect that wired connections are
non-functional. There will not be wifi, or at least it will be weak, in
the social room. Wifi will still be present in the dirty workshop area
and doorbot will remain online.

The new space network will function much the same as the existing
network. If you have a static DHCP assignment, this will continue to
work on the same IP address. Connections to dn42/ChaosVPN will be broken
temporarily as we will not have a static IPv4 address in the new location.

Should someone be looking at a doorbot solution for the new space, you
will need to talk to me about how hub will talk to doorbot. My current
working assumption is that the dn42 connectivity is not urgent, but this
is how doorbot works in the current space.

Looking at usage in the current space, we have used an average of
8GB/month download and 1GB/month upload. The initial connectivity will
be via LTE and will be metered, we can look later at moving to an
unlimited option if this is a problem. Initially I'll load on 10GB,
please refrain from downloading large files for at least the first month.

The modem in the router is unlocked, if someone has an unlimited
contract they are not using then we can just put that SIM card in. The
one I thought I had apparently no longer works.

Lastly, as we will now have windows near to the router, I plan to add a
GPS-based NTP server to the space. I have been hunting around for a USB
GPS receiver but so far not been able to find a spare one that works. If
someone has a USB GPS mouse (U-blox 6 or similar) that provides NMEA
over a USB serial device, that would be awesome.

Thanks,
Iain.
</PRE>
