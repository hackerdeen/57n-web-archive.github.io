<PRE>Hi All,

Do you write things on a blog?
Do you want to help build community?
Do you want to share your latest project?

If yes, please let me know where I can find an RSS feed for your blog so
that it may be added to the 57North Hacklab planet.

  <A HREF="https://planet.57north.org.uk/">https://planet.57north.org.uk/</A>

If you don't yet have a blog and would like to get started, you can set
up a blog easily using free online services. You could set up a
Wordpress account, publish a static blog with Netlify backed by a Git
repository or go all the way and set up your own webserver on the Amazon
AWS free tier.

We want to know what you're up to. Maybe you need some help with your
project, maybe you'd just like to inspire others to take on an
interesting project or maybe you just want to show off. Blogging is for
everyone.

If your blog contains a lot more than would be of interest to the
hackerspace, you can always provide just an RSS feed for a single
category or tag so that only the relevant posts will be syndicated.

Thanks,
Iain.
</PRE>
