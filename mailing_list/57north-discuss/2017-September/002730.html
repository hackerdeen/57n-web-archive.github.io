In case anyone hasn't noticed yet: today is Tuesday.

You should come to the space this evening. You can chat to people,
work on (or procrastinate about) projects or stare at your window to
the internet and wonder what you're doing with your life (but with
other people around).

If you have plans to do any of that: tell us about it over on
-discuss.

I think I'll be along but haven't yet thought far enough ahead to have
any plans.

Tomorrow there is Techmeetup where you can go and hear Ed and Tom tell
you about how they've got along counting you.
