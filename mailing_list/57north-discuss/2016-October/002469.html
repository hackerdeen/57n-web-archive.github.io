<PRE>Hello,

Many of you have been to the Northern Lights conference before so you know how special the day can be. We want you to be there for this year's event. It will be as special as the previous ones. <A HREF="http://northernlightsconf.co.uk/">http://northernlightsconf.co.uk/</A>
Tickets are £18, or £7 for students including lunch, and free for students without lunch.

I know that not all of you can make it for various reasons. But, please forward this then to someone you know who could come to our event. This will be a good day of learning and networking for all participants.

We have a good range of speakers covering technical and policy aspects of conferences and building a better community in different areas of interest. This is also reflected in the specific and the general approaches of the talks.

As before we also have the open space sessions, which people always fine useful and exciting. This is where you can put up a session to ask for help, or offer advice on your favourite topic. This could be where you tell others about your special projects.

We have new approaches to talks this year as part of the #upfront project, which lets those who want to be public speakers in the future see what's it like to be on stage without having to do the speaking. Let me know if you want to be on stage.

As always we'll have coffee, tea and lunch to keep you going with good conversations during the day.

cheers,

Bruce
