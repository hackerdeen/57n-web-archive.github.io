</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Yes, please try this release. It is just great and if you really hard
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you can find the code I wrote.  If anyone wants help I can give helping
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; pointers[2], 0xa5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5 and the like.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm intrigued if that could ever be a real pointer... it's definitely
</I>&gt;<i> got too many bits to map through any virtual memory system I've come
</I>&gt;<i> across, but I'm not sure about things that aren't memory but are
</I>&gt;<i> pretending to be: do they use &quot;invalid&quot; virtual addresses anywhere? In a
</I>&gt;<i> way that could get that far through the 64bit address space? 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As a real address that would be a couple quintillion yottabytes in,
</I>&gt;<i> which would need an impressive machine - I make it about another century
</I>&gt;<i> of Moore's law to get there. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I suppose you might not be indexing bytes. Indexing atoms on earth that
</I>&gt;<i> would only be about a millionth of the way in, so I'll call it plausible
</I>&gt;<i> as a pointer to an atom in a planet. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
You might need more time in gdb. I see  0xa5a5a5a5a5a5a5a5 quite a lot
for uninitialised pointer values, normally I have missed something quite
important and this pointer is a good friend.
