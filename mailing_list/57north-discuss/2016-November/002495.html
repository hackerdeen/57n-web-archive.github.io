I am at a complete loss, I really have no idea where the confusion comes
from. 

Anyone know what other hackerspaces have? hackerspace.pl has this
notification currently:
	
	Sorry We're OPEN
	According to our instruments there are at least 3 people at the
	hackerspace right now.

Looking in the wayback machine I found:

	Sorry We're CLOSED
	According to our instruments there is probably no one at the
	hackerspace right now.

But the open/closed issue is still there, I don't think more words would
make this any clearer to the people that are getting confused.
