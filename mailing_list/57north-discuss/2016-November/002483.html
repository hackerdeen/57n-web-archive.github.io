<PRE>Hiya

I'll be along this week, been a while, with holidays and post-holiday
snow-drift.

I may be mostly rambling about the excellence inaugural ScotlandPHP
conference that was on at the weekend.  Way to much free whiskey, note so
self, if organising a conference, get sponsored by a distillery.  Have a
bunch of stickers for the sticker draw, including some lovely rainbow
elephpants from the diversity php project.  Also will be trying to remember
what I was doing a month ago, last time I was down.

It's the Aberdeen PHP user group tomorrow btw, usual place and time.  Think
they'll be a blurb and roundup of things from the conference, and the
normal beer and pizza.

Random one for the photo geeks, today the sun sets almost bang in line with
Union Street, apparently at 16:25, so that may be a good photo in that.

Cheers
A
