<PRE>Hiya :)

Sorry, been a bit quiet last couple of weeks with work and holidays,
looking forward to being back in the space next week,

I was reading up on the Aberdeen council Creative funding awards
2018/19.  The blurb is online at
<A HREF="https://www.aberdeencity.gov.uk/services/leisure-culture-and-sport/creative-funding-awards-201819">https://www.aberdeencity.gov.uk/services/leisure-culture-and-sport/creative-funding-awards-201819</A>

It seems to have less strings attached than some previous council
initiatives, which is good.  There are some possible issues with us
perhaps not technically being a non-profit, but we can maybe explain
our way round that.

I'm happy doing the application paperwork on behalf of the hackspace.
I've done a few of these funding applications before for various
projects, so comfortable with the lingo and patter.  My feeling is
that with a few Â£k we could do some cool stuff in terms of kit and
outreach etc, also it'd be great for financial sustainability.

Any thoughts, ideas or input?  I should be down the space Tuesday,
happy to chat about it there too.

Dates...
- The deadline for all applications is 5pm on Friday 20 July 2018
- Funding decision by 1 September 2018

Sorry if this has been discussed in the space IRL or in IRC, if so,
let me know what that chat was.

My feeling is it's worth a punt, and we're a pretty good match for
what the funding is aimed at.  With it being quite close to the
deadline it'd probably need a bit of a JFDI approach.

Cheers
Andy
