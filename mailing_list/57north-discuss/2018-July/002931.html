<PRE>Hi,

I plan to be in tonight.......
I have Air Quality Sensor for Steph and Ana which - with luck - might actually work.
With lots of help from Sean - I have a Python tool that flashes the ESP8266s OK.
I have achieved one sensor on the map and another just sending readings (I've not sent the message to get it on the map yet.)
All the procedures to connect to the ESPs only work SOMETIMES! - or I may still be doing something wrong?

Ed - I have another flashed ESP8266 if you want to try swapping out the one that is giving you trouble?
Ana - I have failed to get the list of links to the data together for you - sorry - maybe work on it during meeting?

Mike

Hello Everyone.

Tuesday is the day we host our open day from 7 till late, all are
welcome at our new address [1].

Come along with an intention to work on a project, or distract others
from their projects, or at the very least a laptop so you can blend in
with the usual crowd.

I'll be in drinking Mate, building some door signage and further
customising with our semantic wiki to better track/record space
projects. What will YOU be up to?

Cheers,
Nordin
