Our system currently accepts 0 card types as card reading hasn't been
added yet. The plans to add card reading (as last I heard them - details
may have changed since then...) was to be using PN532 readers. I think
it's 13.56MHz only? There's a couple of readers floating around in the
space if you want to try compatibility with any particular card (though
from last time I saw experiments with them what they'll read does depend
to some degree on what the SW tries to read, so support for anything
wont be final until we have the SW side sorted as well).
I'll be along this evening. Might see if the 3D printer can be made to
work to print Gary.<A HREF="https://github.com/ormiret/3d-gary/blob/master/gary.stl">https://github.com/ormiret/3d-gary/blob/master/gary.stl</A>

Long periods of drought are always followed by rain.
