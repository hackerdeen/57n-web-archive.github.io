<PRE>finzean and garioch will be rebooted in the early hours of the 22nd. 

Everything should come back up, but if you notice anything not working after that (or at any other time): say so here and someone will have a look at it.

Subject: Your BitFolk VPSes (&quot;finzean&quot;, &quot;garioch&quot;) need to be rebooted for critical maintenance
Date: Sun, 18 Feb 2018 08:09:57 +0000

Dear customer,

As part of our plans to protect ourselves and all of our customers
against the Meltdown and Spectre security vulnerabilities, we need to
apply security patches to our hypervisor and reboot everything to put
them into service.

You do not need to respond to this email unless you have questions about
the process.

We must apply these fixes to ensure the security and reliability both
of your VPSes and of our infrastructure. Normally with security
issues there is an embargo period, and we try to give as much notice
as possible. In this case however the embargo broke early and
development continued well after the issues became public. We now
think we're in a good position to provide some mitigation so we must
do so as soon as reasonably possible, so this work will be taking
place in less than a week.

Your VPSes have been assigned a maintenance window during which the
reboots will take place. The start of the maintenance window for each of
your VPSes is listed below, in UTC time zone. Each maintenance window is
up to 60 minutes long, though the work should be completed much sooner
than this, typically within a few minutes (yay, SSDs!).

+-----------------+---------------+--------------------+
|<i> Name            | Main IPv4     | Window start (UTC) |
</I>+-----------------+---------------+--------------------+
|<i>         finzean | 85.119.82.172 | 2018-02-22 01:00   |
</I>|<i>         garioch | 85.119.84.59  | 2018-02-22 02:00   |
</I>+-----------------+---------------+--------------------+

At some point in each maintenance window your VPS will be cleanly shut
down. The host it is on will then be patched and rebooted, and then your
VPS will be brought up again.

You should ensure that your VPS and all its services start up correctly
on boot. We offer a free Nagios monitoring service which can help you to
know if your VPS and its services are working correctly. If you have not
done so already then you may want to get in touch with us to have this
set up. You can do that by replying to this email and describing which
services you would like monitored.

Unfortunately we cannot offer a suspend and restore this time as we are
also upgrading the release of the hypervisor; it is not possible to save
from one version then restore into another. All VPSes will be cleanly
shut down (if possible) and booted again.

If you have any questions please reply to this email, which will open a
support ticket. Please note however that we cannot change the date or
time of the planned maintenance. There is no need to reply to this email
unless you have further questions, or wish to request Nagios monitoring.

Best regards,
Andy Smith
BitFolk Ltd
