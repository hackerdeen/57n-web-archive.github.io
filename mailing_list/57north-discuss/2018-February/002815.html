<PRE>Hi All,

I had originally envisioned a set up where hackers could create
subdomains on hackr.org.uk for their projects, maybe where they need a
Lets Encrypt certificate or just want to stick TXT records into a global
database. For this reason, DNS for hackr.org.uk was hosted on a
dedicated VM [1].

[1]: <A HREF="https://wiki.57north.org.uk/index.php/Computer:Nelson.hackr.org.uk">https://wiki.57north.org.uk/index.php/Computer:Nelson.hackr.org.uk</A>

I have not had the time to produce the scripts around this set up, they
would probably have been integrated into HackHub or maybe pulled from
user pages in the Wiki.

Unless someone is really excited about producing the scripts to make my
vision a reality, I propose to shut down nelson and move the
authoritative DNS for hackr.org.uk to somewhere else. There are two
options that I can see, but I'm open to alternative suggestions:

Option 1) hackr.org.uk's zone files are moved to finzean [2] and served
from there. This is my preferred solution.

[2]: <A HREF="https://wiki.57north.org.uk/index.php/Infrastructure#DNS">https://wiki.57north.org.uk/index.php/Infrastructure#DNS</A>

Option 2) I host the zone from my personal FastMail account. While this
would work, it means that it's not easy to give others access to change
the zone file.

Please let me know your thoughts and ideas.

Thanks,
Iain.
