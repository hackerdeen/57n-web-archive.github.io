It is Tuesday. It has Tuesday been for a while now so you probably
noticed already.

Tuesday means the space will[0] be open to anyone who wants to come
along, bring something to tinker with or just to chat to others.

We will be having a board meeting in the space at 18:30 this
evening. Anyone not on the board is still welcome to attend, and will
probably (it's technically at the discretion of whoever ends up
chairing) be welcome to participate if they want to. The only item on
the agenda at the moment is approving our accounts for submission to
companies house and HMRC.

I will be in and out a bit as there is also a LUG meeting this
evening.

If you have plans for the evening that you want to share: let us know
over on -discuss.

Robert

[0] Actually, it is already.
