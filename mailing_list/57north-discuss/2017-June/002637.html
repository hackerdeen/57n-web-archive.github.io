<PRE>Oops. Double send. Pls forgive.

Liking that quote in yr sig:

The sun never goes down, it's just an illusion caused by the world 
spinning round.

But did you know that the sun moves in a corkscrew motion through the universe? And also, not on an elliptical path, as you might think, being within a galaxy, which is also, as a whole, moving somewhere.... The solar system model gets taught at school and that's the one that sticks in our minds. The sun just sits there in the middle of it all does it? Lol. But anyway, indeed, yes, the sun doesn't &quot;rise&quot; at all. Its interesting that the pre Copernican view point still prevails and despite Catholics waving their hands and lamenting that Copernicus was right after all.

Anyway, back to the social thing.  Chess season coming to an end soon, so should be free of Tues evening. Hope to see you all in a month or so.

Subject: [57north-announce] It's Tuesday

The inevitability of time marching on has brought us round to Tuesday
once again. So, 57N will be open this evening to any of the masses
that feel like coming along to visit. Should be open by 19:00.

If you've not been before: it's best to bring a laptop or a project to
work on.

If anyone has plans for what they'll be doing: let us know over on
-discuss.

I should be along - will probably be doing something with controlling
LEDs, might have a go at actually getting my ESP32 up and running. Or
more likely I'll look at code occasionally and not actually make any
progress...

Robert
