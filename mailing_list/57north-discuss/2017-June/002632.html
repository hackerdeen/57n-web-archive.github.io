Subject: [57north-announce] Open Tuesday.

Hello Everyone.

Tuesday is the day we host our open day from 7 till late, all welcome.

Come along with an intention to work on a project, or distract others from their projects, or at the very least a laptop you can blend in with the usual crowd.

I'll be in attempting to working on a karaoke system.

Doc.
