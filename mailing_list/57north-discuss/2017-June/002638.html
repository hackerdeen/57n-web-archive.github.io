<PRE>Hiya

I can't make it done this evening sadly, as the mrs is on call again.

The Aberdeen PHP user group pub lunch is tomorrow, 12:30 at the Stag on
crown street, all welcome of course.

Also, TechMeetUp tomorrow evening too, Iain doing his Tor thing.

I didn't realise Chess was seasonal, learn something new everyday.

Cheers
Andy

</I>&gt;<i> But did you know that the sun moves in a corkscrew motion through the

</I>&gt;<i> anyway, indeed, yes, the sun doesn't &quot;rise&quot; at all. Its interesting that

</I>&gt;<i> The inevitability of time marching on has brought us round to Tuesday
</I>&gt;<i> once again. So, 57N will be open this evening to any of the masses
</I>&gt;<i> that feel like coming along to visit. Should be open by 19:00.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you've not been before: it's best to bring a laptop or a project to
</I>&gt;<i> work on.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If anyone has plans for what they'll be doing: let us know over on
</I>&gt;<i> -discuss.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I should be along - will probably be doing something with controlling
</I>&gt;<i> LEDs, might have a go at actually getting my ESP32 up and running. Or
</I>&gt;<i> more likely I'll look at code occasionally and not actually make any
</I>&gt;<i> progress...
