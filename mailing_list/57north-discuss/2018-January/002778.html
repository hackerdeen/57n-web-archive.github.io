I won't be in, am in londan fam

&gt;<i> I shall be in for about 630/7ish faffing around with OpenBSD, Raspberry pi and more.

</I>&gt;<i> Relatedly: Can someone bring me a USB SD card reader/writer? Danke!

There should be a (pretty shitty) one in my box, it looks like a small
red usb stick. It sometimes works, sometimes doesn't and it seems to
depend on the host(macs it doesn't like)
