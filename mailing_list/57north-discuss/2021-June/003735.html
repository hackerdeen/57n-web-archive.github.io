<PRE>Hey :)

Open Tuesday, awesome! It's crazy that it is 455 days since we last had an
Open Tuesday. Feels like being a nun, running through alpine fields,
singing with reckless abandon.

I'll be along, tinkering with some CI/CD stuff, and maybe finally powering
on the Pi Pico that I bought ages ago.  Will probably also be looking at
photos of Matt Hancock to see if I can find one where he actually looks
like a human being, rather than a zombie, a wooden toy or someone
pretending to look sad.

See you this evening.

Andy

&gt;<i> Hi All,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Aberdeen City remains at protection level 1, which means we are now able
</I>&gt;<i> to invite you to return for OPEN TUESDAY. We will start around 7pm and
</I>&gt;<i> remain at our location in Unit H, Kettock Lodge, Campus Two, Innovation
</I>&gt;<i> Park, AB22 8GU.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We are participating in the Scottish Government's contact tracing
</I>&gt;<i> programme. You will find purple posters at the entrance to the space and
</I>&gt;<i> around the space that contain QR codes. Please scan the QR code and
</I>&gt;<i> provide your contact details. If you are unable to scan a QR code, there
</I>&gt;<i> is a link to type into your browser. If you cannot use the link, ask
</I>&gt;<i> someone else to check in for you and provide them with your email
</I>&gt;<i> address and phone number.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please note that contact tracing is a requirement of participating in an
</I>&gt;<i> Open Tuesday in person, and is not negotiable. If you do not provide
</I>&gt;<i> tracing details you will be asked to leave.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As we emerge from this global disaster, some will understandably be
</I>&gt;<i> cautious about being outside. Please respect people's boundaries by
</I>&gt;<i> maintaining social distancing and wearing a mask as you move around the
</I>&gt;<i> space. If you are sat down, you can take off your mask to have easier
</I>&gt;<i> access to your face if needed for eating or drinking. Use common sense
</I>&gt;<i> and remember this is a shared space.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'll be in early to open all the windows to get air flowing through the
</I>&gt;<i> space. It could be a good idea to bring a jumper or something as the
</I>&gt;<i> space could be a little cooler than you might expect because of this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you're coming in today, maybe send a mail to the list.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i> Iain.
