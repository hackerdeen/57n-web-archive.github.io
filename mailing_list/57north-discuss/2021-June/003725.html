<PRE>Hi Hackers

At the recent AGM and board meeting, we discussed what best to do in re
Covid and various eventualities.  Although the space has been open for
members, for the sake of reduced risk, we've not really encouraged use of
it.  In hindsight we could have managed and communicated this better, but
these have been challenging and complicated times.

We've been working through the Scottish Government guidelines &quot;Coronavirus
(COVID-19): guidance for creative studios and shared workspaces&quot; which
seemed the most applicable to us.  While the documentation is not always
totally clear, it does provide a useful framework and checklists we've been
able to work though that.
<A HREF="https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-creative-studios-and-shared-workspaces/">https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-creative-studios-and-shared-workspaces/</A>

So, generally, it seemed sensible to have Member's tuesdays at level 2, and
Open tuesdays at level 1.

In today's awesome news, Aberdeen is going to switch to level 1 on
Saturday, so we can have the first Open Tuesday of the year next Tuesday,
which will be lovely.  You can read about the changes announced today at
<A HREF="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-57315436">https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-57315436</A>

We'll keep on with the WorkAdventure, I'll be along this evening and we can
connect folk in the space with Jitsi chat via WorkAdventure. Hopefully
that'll work ok, connecting the space with cyberspace.
The WorkAdventure URL is

as usual.

See you in the space or in WorkAdventure :)

Cheers
57N Board


TL:DR
# Open tuesday next week, once in level 1
# Members come along this evening if you're comfortable doing so
# WorkAdventure as well, hybrid style
