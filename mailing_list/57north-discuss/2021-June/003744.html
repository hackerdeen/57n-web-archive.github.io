</I>&gt;<i> ﻿Hi All,
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's open Tuesday at 57North Hacklab! Apparently there is now internet
</I>&gt;<i> so you can now get your meme fix from the space. We will start around
</I>&gt;<i> 7pm and remain at our location in Unit H, Kettock Lodge, Campus Two,
</I>&gt;<i> Innovation Park, AB22 8GU.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'll be there from 7pm. If you're coming in today, consider sending a reply
</I>&gt;<i> with an optional rundown of your excellent evening's plans. I'll be working
</I>&gt;<i> on adding fans to my PiPuter case and making more tiny metal models.
</I>&gt;<i> I *might* have the space's MATE delivery with me also (yet to confirm).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As is custom during these times, please review the important COVID info
</I>&gt;<i> below.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> See you there,
</I>&gt;<i> Nordin
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;COVID related blurb&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> Aberdeen City remains at protection level 1, which means we can invite
</I>&gt;<i> people to our open Tuesday events.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We are participating in the Scottish Government's contact tracing
</I>&gt;<i> programme. You will find purple posters at the entrance to the space and
</I>&gt;<i> around the space that contain QR codes. Please scan the QR code and
</I>&gt;<i> provide your contact details. If you are unable to scan a QR code, there
</I>&gt;<i> is a link to type into your browser. If you cannot use the link, ask
</I>&gt;<i> someone else to check in for you and provide them with your email
</I>&gt;<i> address and phone number.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Please note that contact tracing is a requirement of participating in an
</I>&gt;<i> Open Tuesday in person, and is not negotiable. If you do not provide
</I>&gt;<i> tracing details you will be asked to leave.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> As we emerge from this global disaster, some will understandably be
</I>&gt;<i> cautious about being outside. Please respect people's boundaries by
</I>&gt;<i> maintaining social distancing and wearing a mask as you move around the
</I>&gt;<i> space. If you are sat down, you can take off your mask to have easier
</I>&gt;<i> access to your face if needed for eating or drinking. Use common sense
</I>&gt;<i> and remember this is a shared space.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you are in early, open windows to get air flowing through the
</I>&gt;<i> space. It could be a good idea to bring a jumper or something as the
</I>&gt;<i> space could be a little cooler than you might expect because of this.
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;/COVID related blurb&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> 57North Hacklab Ltd. is a company registered in Scotland (No. SC470230).
</I>&gt;<i> 57North and 57North Hacklab are trading names of 57North Hacklab Ltd.
