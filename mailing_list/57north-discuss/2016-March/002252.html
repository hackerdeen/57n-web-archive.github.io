<PRE>I have a friend who owns a shop in Tory that's under &#163;350 a month and is
looking for someone to take over the lease. I don't know the spec, but she
has passed me her email so you can contact her.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> *Sent on behalf of the 57North Board of Directors*
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Dear 57N members, visitors and followers
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As you may know, your directors have been collecting options around moving
</I>&gt;<i> to a
</I>&gt;<i> larger space. Our limiting factor has been our relatively low income in a
</I>&gt;<i> pretty expensive city. Recently, we've been looking into a local unit
</I>&gt;<i> (half a
</I>&gt;<i> large room) on George Street above the Eco Hub shop.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * The good parts:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     - The unit itself is half a first floor room, roughly the same floor
</I>&gt;<i> area
</I>&gt;<i>       as our present space but with more height (good for taller storage).
</I>&gt;<i> It
</I>&gt;<i>       is up a single flight of stairs via a corridor with space for
</I>&gt;<i> lockers.
</I>&gt;<i>       The unit's rear door leads up from a car park, available after 6pm.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     - The landlord does not require a deposit and is keen to help and work
</I>&gt;<i>       alongside a group such like us. He has a number of small projects
</I>&gt;<i> ideas
</I>&gt;<i>       he would offer, with kit, to anyone interested e.g. lighting showroom
</I>&gt;<i>       design, product prototyping and experimenting with fuel cells.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     - At this location we'd have control of the outside door so we'd have
</I>&gt;<i> actual
</I>&gt;<i>       24/7 access to the space.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * The less good parts:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     - The unit/room requires us to refit it. We would need to add:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         * more power sockets
</I>&gt;<i>         * network sockets
</I>&gt;<i>         * storage
</I>&gt;<i>         * desks
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>       This would have to be done with space volunteers
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     - We might have to start paying for internet connection, we cannot
</I>&gt;<i> assume
</I>&gt;<i>       our current sponsor will transfer our account. We are looking into
</I>&gt;<i> this
</I>&gt;<i>       but safer to assume we will lose this.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     - The unit is more expensive to rent and the rate will increase as time
</I>&gt;<i>       goes on.  It is an extra &#163;45 per month initially compared to our
</I>&gt;<i> current rate and
</I>&gt;<i>       increases by &#163;70 ontop in 6 months, then by another &#163;50 ontop of
</I>&gt;<i> that nearer to
</I>&gt;<i>       2018. This does not include any utilities.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We are only just about meeting our present costs, therefore we would need
</I>&gt;<i> to
</I>&gt;<i> significantly increase our income prior to moving and have to maintain it
</I>&gt;<i> once
</I>&gt;<i> we move.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The directors propose we should only consider such a move if we can:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     (a) increase our income by an additional &#163;120/month on top of the
</I>&gt;<i> current,
</I>&gt;<i>         which will provide us with enough income for approx. 7 months
</I>&gt;<i> under new
</I>&gt;<i>         space rent/electric/internet
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     (b) gather enough interest from members to actually perform the move.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Addressing (a), one proposal is to ask members for sustained monthly
</I>&gt;<i> pledges on
</I>&gt;<i> top of their usual rate over the next 7 month period totalling &#163;120/month
</I>&gt;<i> of
</I>&gt;<i> additional income. Meeting this for the next 7 months would give us
</I>&gt;<i> breathing
</I>&gt;<i> room to increase membership and reach for funding.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> For point (b), we suggest a separate show of hands for people who can
</I>&gt;<i> commit time, tools, transport and possibly money for materials. It would be
</I>&gt;<i> a great group project for those that are keen.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Comments only please at this stage. If we proceed, we'll arrange for
</I>&gt;<i> pledges to
</I>&gt;<i> received privately. Please either reply to this email or contact the
</I>&gt;<i> directors
</I>&gt;<i> directly with comments and feedback, using the email below.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards,
</I>&gt;<i>
