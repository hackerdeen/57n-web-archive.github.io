<PRE>Hi Rob

Happy to help with the software, only downside is that I can't make it to
the mini maker faire itself.  I'd write sensible code with comments etc
though, so hopefully that shouldn't be a problem if any tweaks or debugging
is required in location.

I'll be down the space this evening, can chat it through then if you're
heading along too.

Cheers

Andy

&gt;<i> Some of us had discussed making a video wall thing for the Edinburgh

</I>&gt;<i> The faire is coming up fast (less than a month away!) and I am nothing

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The rest of the work splits up into writing the firmware for the FPGA,
</I>&gt;<i> and the software to feed it images. If I could get someone else to take
</I>&gt;<i> care of the SW side it would help the chances of this working (and my
</I>&gt;<i> sanity) greatly. Also if anyone want's to pick up the FPGA side I am
</I>&gt;<i> more than happy to do nothing :)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My plan for the software was to have something read in image files,
</I>&gt;<i> scale them to the right resolution (I think 800x600, remind me to check
</I>&gt;<i> before you start coding against that), reduce the colour to 3 bits (one
</I>&gt;<i> each for red, green and blue) and then send that down to the FPGA (if I
</I>&gt;<i> do get a volunteer, I'll document how that happens). I had vague plans
</I>&gt;<i> for a web interface to that (and did think about making it publicly
</I>&gt;<i> accessible - it would probably be best to have a moderation feature to
</I>&gt;<i> approve things before they go on the screens if we do implement that). I
</I>&gt;<i> was thinking to write it in python as I know the PIL can handle the
</I>&gt;<i> image parts quite easily, but if someone has a different preference I
</I>&gt;<i> don't particularly care.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Can I rope anyone in to help with this?
