<PRE>Hi All,

It does not need to be a secret that this is me. I am proud to want a
clean and tidy space.

&gt;<i> Finally, Trashing. If something that takes up space is unclaimed,
</I>&gt;<i> persistently unsafe or just not wanted then it should be considered for
</I>&gt;<i> trashing.
</I>
Please note: items in the vortex of doom are not listed here as someone
has already decided they should be trashed, you will have to check the
vortex yourself if you want to see what is in there.

As the vortex has not been regularly rotated, I would like to restart
the rotation on the 2nd April. Any items that have not been claimed by
the 2nd April will be thrown out *regardless* of when they were placed
into the vortex.

&gt;<i> A wiki page now exists for listing these items and I hereby
</I>&gt;<i> volunteer to transport items via van to waste at regular intervals.
</I>
Thanks for volunteering, we should document this on the wiki so that if
it is not happening we know who to ask. (Not so we can harass you to do
it, but so we can be aware that someone else needs to do it if you
can't/won't do it for whatever reason).

&gt;<i> It
</I>&gt;<i> was tentatively suggested that some time during the last Tuesday of the
</I>&gt;<i> month should be devoted to tidying and sorting. I have gone on to add
</I>&gt;<i> that maybe that day's Tuesday announce emails should call attention to
</I>&gt;<i> the 'large item' and 'trashing pages' for the membership to check and
</I>&gt;<i> maybe claim.
</I>
I'm not convinced this can/should be done on an open night, but I'm
willing to give it a go. We need a wiki page with a checklist on things
that need to be done so they can be distributed among members.

&gt;<i> We have evolved most of our current space practices by collecting
</I>&gt;<i> comments until objections cease. Please voice your opinions to the above
</I>&gt;<i> to help us dial it in right. 
</I>This is really not a great decision making methodology. ):

If it's acceptable to other members though then, again, I'll go along
with it.

Thanks,
Iain.
