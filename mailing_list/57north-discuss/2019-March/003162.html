<PRE>So.

Your friendly local curling rink[1] runs a number of competitions every year, some of which are particularly high profile. 

In the world of curling, livestreaming on Youtube is the norm, with the world body driving expansion of the sport via high quality broadcasts on Youtube[2] that are also sold to Eurosport and other TV networks. It's big a money business out in the Far East!

We were idly discussing over the weekend about streaming. Other places in Scotland are doing it, but to not quite such a high level of quality [3]... Naturally, no one has budget , time or volunteers to implement something professional, but I think there's probably ways and means of doing this on the (relatively) cheap to get reasonable results that may drive budget and volunteers. 

Curling provides some interesting challenges, and it's been bouncing around my head for a little while. The ice sheet is roughly 45m long, and I'd probably want at least a PTZ camera at each end. Perhaps wifi is the way to go... Maybe wired ethernet is a safer choice for performance, however, but presenting its own challenges with cable routing. 
I wonder what cameras I can use - cheap 1080p PTZ surveillance ones  from ebay? More expensive brand name ones?

I was looking towards OBS[4] as a core software and building out from there. 

By the end of the project, I'd like to have built a documented, template system that can be put in a single plastic box. 
A couple of cameras, a switch/router maybe, some instructions on how to set up software and a potential expansion for audio/commentary. 

Ideally, this would be flexible enough to allow other members of our extended family &amp; community to borrow it, but also for people elsewhere to look at it and say &quot;I want to make that&quot; and copy it. Perhaps someone has already done this and I'm wasting my time!

If anyone would like to help, throw some suggestions on the project wiki page [5]. I'm probably going to try and have a system setup for campGND[6] (stream the talks!) that can be refined/fiddled with/changed going forward.

Jesus christ why do I keep getting dragged into things I find slightly interesting?
