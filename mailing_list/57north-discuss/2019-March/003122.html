<PRE>Hi All,

The following items have been identified as taking up more space than
they are useful. Each of these items has had a large item removal
warning attached to it.

These warnings are completely made up and have no basis in either the
articles of association, the rules or elsewhere. Attempts to lawyer
yourself out of a warning would just be silly.

Please recognise that you are a member of an association that has a
*shared* space and that a fellow member is raising an issue with your
use of the space.

You may raise counter-issues but please keep everything pragmatic.

I propose that these items be free for disposal/hacking/taking away if
their presence has not been justified within 2 weeks to the satisfaction
of other members.

Thanks,
Iain.

---------
1. Robot Vacuum / Under main shelves / Social Room

This actually is one of my items. It is non-functional and so cannot yet
serve as a shared resource. I will post a separate mail about this
shortly. If you are responsible for one of the above items, you might
want to use my mail as an example.
---------
2. 2x CRT Oscilloscopes / Rear desk / Social Room

I've not seen these used and they do take up a lot of space. At the very
least we could reduce the number to 1 and build it into a shelf or
something. Even better though would be to get rid of both and replace
with a digital scope.
---------
3. HP Tower Computer / Under front desk / Social Room

I remember the discussion about this being donated, but I don't see that
anyone has adopted this project to get the machine running. If someone
is working on this please speak up, maybe others could chip in to help.
If not, we should consider removing it.
---------
4. Large Black Case / Under main shelves / Social Room

This looks like a useful case. Is it meant to be a shared resource?
Maybe we can document this. If this is a personal item then it is really
too large and we should remove it.
---------
5. Cool Looking Typewriter / On main shelves / Social Room

This looks like a cool project and I'd like to know more about it, but
also it is using up a whole members box worth of space. Can the owner
speak up on the mailing list?
---------
6. Light Panel from Union Street / Under main shelves / Social Room

This isn't used anymore and seems to have had its insides stripped out.
To be able to hoover under the shelves I have tidied the cables away
inside the box but I didn't cut anything to ensure that if someone did
have plans for it then I wouldn't be ruining them. Are there plans?
---------
7. UV LED Clock Sign / Rear desk / Social Room

This is taking up a lot of space, but could be better organised and take
up less space. I spoke to Rob about this in IRC and he tells me that
lots of work is planned to improve the situation. It would be good to
hear more about this work on the mailing list. As there is *currently* a
problem, I have attached a warning notice.
