<PRE>Hi :)

I'm kind of reluctant to wade in to discussions, but, it seems like it
is good that a spectrum of views are communicated about matters re our
shared space. So, some thoughts re all this...

Any effort to tidy up the place is great, generally, thank you.

While this process is well intentioned, I think leaving warning notes
on people's stuff is a bit heavy handed, including subjective
assessments that many might not agree with and some turns of phrase
that some might read as passive aggressive.

Personally, I like to see other people's projects, if the place is
spotless and uncluttered, this pleasure would be removed.  There is
lots to learn from other people's project journeys, that sort of cross
pollination and mutual inspiration.  The clock is an example of this,
it's a cool project and something I've been enjoying seeing take
shape, although it is quite large, it's not large in terms of
workspace used, personally, I'd prefer to see it in the space than
not.

We don't have so many members, we have quite a lot of space now, I
think that means it's ok to leave in-progress work out, to a degree.
If we had twice as many members, we'd probably have to revisit this.

I was at BeCycle a couple of weeks ago, although they are open every
Wednesday and Saturday, they make every last Saturday of the month a
cleaning and sorting day.  I think this might work well for us really.
Perhaps every 1st Tuesday we could set aside this way.  It'd be good
to do this on a Tuesday, generally, as more members are in, so there
is more opportunity to discus things face to face, which is quicker
and friendlier than leaving notes for each other.  Having a regular
day a month for this would allow us to coordinate efforts and will
probably mean the space improves over time, as an environment.  There
are, I think, many benefits of cleaning and sorting being a scheduled
communal space activity.

Using the hackspace branding is fine, but it does convey something as
coming communally from the space, which is not the case here.  I'm not
suggesting we need a branding committee, but perhaps if doing
something under the 57n brand it is maybe a good idea to casually
sound out one or two people first.  Just a v quick &quot;Hmm... I was
thinking of doing X, with the 57n branding, does that sound ok?&quot; on
IRC would do.

Just some thoughts really, hope some is useful.

Thanks

Andy
