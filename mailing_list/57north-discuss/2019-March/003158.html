<PRE>I feel this should be discussed in person on a Tuesday night when there are
people about.

An email discussion on this matter won't be as productive as doing it in
person.

&gt;<i> Hi All,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please read this whole email, I am proposing changes and would like to
</I>&gt;<i> give opportunity for members to object before I implement them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I was in last night for cleaning and tidying. A couple of things to note:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> * The bins could have done with emptying. The general waste bin was
</I>&gt;<i> about 80% full, which means that it's going to be 160% full by the end
</I>&gt;<i> of the next open night if waste production is constant. The recycling
</I>&gt;<i> bin does not use bags and can be emptied at any time.
</I>&gt;<i> * There was a lot of sawdust under a bench in the workshop. I have
</I>&gt;<i> hoovered this up, but please clean up after yourself if you are doing
</I>&gt;<i> dirty work. Sawdust and other dusty things especially can get tracked
</I>&gt;<i> around the space on people's shoes and make it a lot harder to keep
</I>&gt;<i> everything clean. Try to leave things as tidy or tidier than you found it.
</I>&gt;<i> * There was a Raspberry Pi charger left on the desk in the social room.
</I>&gt;<i> Does this belong to someone? Should it have gone in your box or is this
</I>&gt;<i> just for anyone to use? This isn't using much space but if no one can
</I>&gt;<i> confidently answer questions like this then we end up being scared to
</I>&gt;<i> move it in case someone gets upset that their unlabeled abandoned
</I>&gt;<i> Raspberry Pi charger was left on a shared workspace and got moved.
</I>&gt;<i> * There are a ton of empty cardboard boxes. These do take up
</I>&gt;<i> considerable space. Is anyone saving Club Mate boxes for any particular
</I>&gt;<i> reason? The packing pellets from those boxes are getting everywhere, I
</I>&gt;<i> find more every time I hoover. There is one Club Mate box in the
</I>&gt;<i> workshop with an M&amp;S bag with a sweater in it. What is this? Why is it
</I>&gt;<i> there?
</I>&gt;<i> * Other boxes that I would like to get rid of include the Shop Vac box.
</I>&gt;<i> We love the Shop Vac, it is great, but do we need to keep the box?
</I>&gt;<i> * I have written up some draft rules for managing our members' storage
</I>&gt;<i> area. They are available on the wiki at:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="https://wiki.57north.org.uk/index.php/Member_Storage.">https://wiki.57north.org.uk/index.php/Member_Storage.</A> I would like to
</I>&gt;<i> implement these rules soon, and will do so if there are no objections.
</I>&gt;<i> Those in violation of the policy will be contacted after its
</I>&gt;<i> implementation to work out how they would like to comply.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks,
</I>&gt;<i> Iain.
