Good to restart this but we may need to check the boxes are actually
full of trash - some items might be useful. From what I recall, the
rotation was done to make sure at least one box was empty - otherwise
it was left as a bits-box.

My volunteering has been added to the Trashing page.

&gt;<i> &gt; It
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; was tentatively suggested that some time during the last Tuesday of the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; month should be devoted to tidying and sorting. I have gone on to add
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that maybe that day's Tuesday announce emails should call attention to
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; the 'large item' and 'trashing pages' for the membership to check and
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; maybe claim.
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>
This is just a once-a-month opportunity to tidy and coordinate trashing
as a group. Probably needs to be 6-7 if disrupting members is a concern.

&gt;<i> &gt; We have evolved most of our current space practices by collecting
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; comments until objections cease. Please voice your opinions to the above
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; to help us dial it in right.
</I>&gt;<i> This is really not a great decision making methodology. ):
</I>&gt;<i> If it's acceptable to other members though then, again, I'll go along
</I>&gt;<i> with it.
</I>
This is more a way to generate good practise, not a complete decision
making methodology in itself. We have other things for that.

Cheers,
Ed
