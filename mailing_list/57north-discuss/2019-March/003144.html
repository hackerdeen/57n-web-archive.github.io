<PRE>Hi All,

Some things have changed around in the social room today.

The first thing, and perhaps the most important, is that in general
there is agreement that dirty work (metalwork/woodwork) should not be
happening in the social room. As such, all power tools and things
specifically for dirty work have been removed and placed in the workshop
area.

The other things are related to some things moving around. I've fitted a
monitor between the desk at the front and the main shelves to serve the
shop (which Hibby is working on). I've also put a trolley under the
monitor which is housing some of the shop items.

The rear desk has had the iMac stowed under the desk for now as it is
nearing the end of its usefulness. Ed still needs to recover some data
from it so it can't leave the space just yet. The laptop from that desk
is now set up as a replacement for the iMac with a second monitor attached.

If you want to move things around on this desk temporarily then that is
fine but please put things back where you found them. The laptop was
useful today because it has an optical drive and a member needed to get
the contents off a CD.

Thanks,
Iain.
