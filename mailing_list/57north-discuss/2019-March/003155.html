<PRE>Hi,

If there is concern that the 2nd April is too soon, then we can extend
this. No one is arguing that we should throw out useful things. This is why:

a) I will go through the boxes personally to identify things that may be
useful as tools or as consumables
b) All members have until the 2nd April to do this themselves too

If you are concerned that I might not see usefulness in something that
you would see usefulness in, then tell me. Anyone can decide that
something is useful. If we decide it is useful then we just need to find
it a place to live, it doesn't belong in the vortex.

If we have disagreements then we get to pick a process for deciding what
to do.

&gt;<i> This is just a once-a-month opportunity to tidy and coordinate trashing

</I>
My concern is more that members would disrupt the tidying. It is based
on how I can imagine it going, and may be different in practice, so I am
willing to try it.

&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> We have evolved most of our current space practices by collecting
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> comments until objections cease. Please voice your opinions to the above
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> to help us dial it in right.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is really not a great decision making methodology. ):
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If it's acceptable to other members though then, again, I'll go along
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This is more a way to generate good practise, not a complete decision
</I>&gt;<i> making methodology in itself. We have other things for that.
</I>
I believe we're making enough progress that we don't need fundamental
changes at the moment. It is good to exercise our processes and see if
there are sticking points.

Thanks,
Iain.
