<PRE>Hi,

&gt;<i> Just quickly, is it safe to assume that by said not to 'lawyer your way

</I>
I would prefer that people argue that they are using the space in a
useful way than argue that this procedure is just made up so you don't
have to follow it. I've admitted it's completely made up already, so we
can get over that point.

&gt;<i> A wiki page with photos seems a wider-reaching way to go. We did an
</I>&gt;<i> email version sucessfully before in the last space so a wiki page seems
</I>&gt;<i> a good next step since it means people who cannot physically access the
</I>&gt;<i> space can see/vote on a shared platform.
</I>
I don't believe it is my job to advocate for other's use of the space,
especially with regard to projects I do not understand as they have not
been communicated (or not communicated recently). The members will be
able to best represent their own projects.

To be clear, this is not a vote on whether or not we should keep
something. It is to ask for discussion on whether or not we should keep
something, for how long, and for what purpose. It is to help us all
think more critically about our use of the space and how it affects
other members.

&gt;<i> Can you confirm you are placing 'warning' statements on physical items?
</I>&gt;<i> If all members did this we'd have to clean stickers off items that were
</I>&gt;<i> kept, plus the wording is not conducive to it being a member suggestion.
</I>
It is an A4 piece of paper. It is not physically attached to the item to
avoid damaging the item.

&gt;<i> As other members may wish to take part, would you be offended if I took
</I>&gt;<i> pics of your marked items on Tuesday, made wiki page of them with note
</I>&gt;<i> areas for members to attribute their names against for suggested
</I>&gt;<i> rehoming? I would seek to remove the stickers only when fully transferred.
</I>
If you want to do this, please go ahead! I did plan to also share the A4
notice PDF so that others may use this to call out large items for
discussion.

In the longer term I would like to see a storage committee formed that
can fill in this page:

Thanks,
Iain.
