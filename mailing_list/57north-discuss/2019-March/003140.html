Ah sure - a 'vote with your feet' thing then maybe. Doing it when others
have assembled provides quick spare opinions which is a plus.

This will be a change for some people, and people resist change. This is
&gt;<i> just human nature. It is going to upset people. It is a good thing for

</I>

Possibly so but all the more reason it should be done with a tact that a
majority will not find overbearing.

&gt;<i> Speaking as a member, I want a space that encourages projects,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; especially infrastructure/facility projects. This inevitably means some
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; large projects will 'live out' until done/installed but sure we can all
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; get better at leaving desk spaces clear for others.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Speaking as a member, I too want a space that encourages projects. If
</I>&gt;<i> there are infrastructure/facility projects then by definition these are
</I>&gt;<i> for the benefit of all members of the space. Why not tell the members
</I>&gt;<i> about these projects?
</I>

Wiki works well here and I for one want to use the projects bit more for my
stuff. The wiki project area was fixed a while back but maybe people dont
know this.

Cheers,
Nordin
