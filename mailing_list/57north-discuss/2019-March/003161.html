There have been other workshops run in the space. I would like to resume
the &quot;quiet hacking night&quot; that we had at the old space, which is where
we sit in the social room and don't talk to each other while we focus on
working on a project.

This sounds like an excellent use of the space and I would encourage it.
I too have used the space during the day to get work done, to have a
change of scenery. Often I will bump into a few other members who are
also in during the day which is nice too.

&gt;<i> Thanks for rescuing the network cables from the Vortex BTW,
</I>
I did not do this yet, but I'm sure they will not be thrown out. I had
less time than I thought I would have yesterday so really only did the
hoovering and the bins.

Thanks,
Iain.
