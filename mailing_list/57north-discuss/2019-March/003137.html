There's no vote here. If you would like to kickstart a group tidy/sort
this evening then just do it, as I did with hoovering and trash removal
at the weekend. I will help you.

This will be a change for some people, and people resist change. This is
just human nature. It is going to upset people. It is a good thing for
the space though, a clean and tidy space will encourage projects.
Hopefully, a clean and tidy space will also encourage tidying away after
yourself and keeping the space clean and tidy.

Speaking as a member, I too want a space that encourages projects. If
there are infrastructure/facility projects then by definition these are
for the benefit of all members of the space. Why not tell the members
about these projects?

I am not arguing that large items cannot be stored in the space. I am
arguing that their storage should be justified by their value to the
members of the space. This may simply be that it's a cool project that
all the members support but do not want to be involved in. It may be a
group project. It may be an infrastructure project that all members can
benefit from.

Thanks,
Iain.
