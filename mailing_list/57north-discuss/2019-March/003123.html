<PRE>Hi All,

As I've been doing some tidying of the space and no one has been
available to help, I tried to recruit a robot. This was purchased this a
long time ago from Lidl. It stopped working and we never really looked
at it again. Having cleaned it out it did go again for a short time but
then it stopped again.

I think it would be great to have a robot vacuum for the social room to
keep things nice. Is anyone interested in picking up the project?

I suspect the issue is with a plastic component that I bent a bit that
is causing some sticking on the main brushes and is being interpreted as
a jam. Some 3D printing would fix it right up (maybe).

I'll be in the space tomorrow for open day and would be happy to talk to
anyone interested in taking on this project.

As this is a large item that is currently taking up space outside my box
I have attached a large item removal notice to it, so the 2 week period
to decide if it is worth keeping around starts today.

Thanks,
Iain.
