<PRE>This sound's great I don't know if I have time to invest but I think
this is a good Idea I would be happy to test it at events, with the
social centre. Also I'm sure you have had a look but ccc.tv apparently
have a premier setup.

&gt;<i> So.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Your friendly local curling rink[1] runs a number of competitions every year, some of which are particularly high profile. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> In the world of curling, livestreaming on Youtube is the norm, with the world body driving expansion of the sport via high quality broadcasts on Youtube[2] that are also sold to Eurosport and other TV networks. It's big a money business out in the Far East!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We were idly discussing over the weekend about streaming. Other places in Scotland are doing it, but to not quite such a high level of quality [3]... Naturally, no one has budget , time or volunteers to implement something professional, but I think there's probably ways and means of doing this on the (relatively) cheap to get reasonable results that may drive budget and volunteers. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Curling provides some interesting challenges, and it's been bouncing around my head for a little while. The ice sheet is roughly 45m long, and I'd probably want at least a PTZ camera at each end. Perhaps wifi is the way to go... Maybe wired ethernet is a safer choice for performance, however, but presenting its own challenges with cable routing. 
</I>&gt;<i> I wonder what cameras I can use - cheap 1080p PTZ surveillance ones  from ebay? More expensive brand name ones?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I was looking towards OBS[4] as a core software and building out from there. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> By the end of the project, I'd like to have built a documented, template system that can be put in a single plastic box. 
</I>&gt;<i> A couple of cameras, a switch/router maybe, some instructions on how to set up software and a potential expansion for audio/commentary. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ideally, this would be flexible enough to allow other members of our extended family &amp; community to borrow it, but also for people elsewhere to look at it and say &quot;I want to make that&quot; and copy it. Perhaps someone has already done this and I'm wasting my time!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If anyone would like to help, throw some suggestions on the project wiki page [5]. I'm probably going to try and have a system setup for campGND[6] (stream the talks!) that can be refined/fiddled with/changed going forward.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Jesus christ why do I keep getting dragged into things I find slightly interesting?
