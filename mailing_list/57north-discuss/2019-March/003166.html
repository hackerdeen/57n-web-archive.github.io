<PRE>Hiya

I'll try to head along, not sure though, depends on usual domestic juggling.

I've been tinkering with 3.5&quot; Pi screeen, so if I'm along I'll be doing
that.  Picked up a couple, Chinese import, and they're really nice for the
price.  Only issue so far it the touch screen input needs rotated 90
degrees.  I think I might try and make light switch replacements with them,
for IoT control type stuff, or something.  Added some images and stuff to
the wiki page at <A HREF="https://wiki.57north.org.uk/index.php/Projects:IPi">https://wiki.57north.org.uk/index.php/Projects:IPi</A>

Also, a new Pi 3 A+ arrived in the post just now, the cute wee thing needs
tinkered with.  It is quite satisfyingly square :)

In case anyone was wanting to go to the &quot;CodeTheCity: Working with
Wikidata, Wikimedia and Wikipedia&quot; this evening, there may be a ticket
available now.  I booked, but had to cancel my ticket yesterday, as I
wasn't sure if I'd be able top go.  More info at

TechMeetup tomorrow evening sounds good.  More info at
<A HREF="https://www.facebook.com/events/1051097708411563/">https://www.facebook.com/events/1051097708411563/</A> or, if you're not so keen
on clicking facebook stuff, the blurb is...

Jane Wilson on Web Accessibility
Tomorrow from 18:30-21:00, Meston Building, University of Aberdeen, AB24
3UE Aberdeen
Jane Wilson from Waracle in Dundee, will talk about web accessibility and
show that it's not a big and scary a topic. That really easy code changes
and design considerations can make a big difference when it comes to making
accessible experiences. She'll also cover how accessibility assumptions are
wrong and that this has a much wider impact on your user base.
