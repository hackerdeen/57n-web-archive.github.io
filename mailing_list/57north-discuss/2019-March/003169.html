Sounds like a cool project, best deal plan going forward is to get like
10-20k for equipment. I don't think it is a crazy ask, I am sure someone
will fund it.

As for a PoC, these all sound like the correct peices, OBS is the right
thing to use. There are some ideas in my talk that you liknk in the
thread, but it is a different end goal. 

At work we have PTZ cameras that have a serial control interface,
unfortuneately they output analog video. We use a Roland 4VEX video
mixer to digitise the video, that is a 4k item (see you quickly need
lots of money).

For a POC we might be able to arrange tests with the stuff from work, I
would have to ask when I return from the ietf (mid april).

Beyond that you need to think about audio (do others do it) and
operators. This will take atleast 1 person to run, but I think more like
3.

There is a lot to this idea, could be fun to play with. I'll give it
some more thought on the remaining 13 hours of this flight (4 down!)
