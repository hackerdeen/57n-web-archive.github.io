<PRE>Happy new year!

It's a new year, a new week, and it's also Tuesday, so it's 57 North's
first open Tuesday of 2020.

So, If you've not been before, come on along and see what it's all about.
&gt;<i>From 7pm ish until around 11pm, at Unit H, upstairs at Kettock Lodge,
</I>Campus Two, Balgownie Drive, Bridge of Don, Aberdeen, AB22 8GU.

Feel free to reply, let us know what you've got planned, how your holiday
was, or just what the weather is like out your nearest window.

I'll be working on my geo data project thing, or perhaps just 3d printing
elephants.

Looking forward to hearing tales of daring do and heroic hacking from the
folk who went to CCC in Germany last week, or was it the week before.  It
always sounds like a ball.
