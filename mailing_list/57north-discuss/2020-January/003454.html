<PRE>Hi,

A few more details:

SFRS have the cost of an unwanted fire alarm callout at ~£2000 per
callout. Outside working hours, they will always respond with 2
appliances, this is a lot of wasted money, time and blue-light travel
that poses real risk to others lives. There is no way to call them off
once the alarm has been triggered (we tried but no one would believe us
that there was no fire). Once the sensor is triggered it is too late.

Thanks,
Iain.
