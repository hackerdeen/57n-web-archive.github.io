<PRE>Dear Members

The directors were notified of a potential new space location just off
Skene Terrace, underneath 'Engage gaming' [1], a local business
providing PC/console gaming facilities - basically gaming hardware,
desks, soft seating and a bar. We visited the location last week and
have composed a short review of the main points for discussion with
the membership.

The Skene Terrace entrance [2] - which would be our lockable point of
entry - overlooks the Union Terrace/Rosemount Viaduct junction and
across that, the library. The street entrance leads to a wide
stairwell landing, between two flights. Going up a flight takes you to
a toilet/shower area and a few further flights up take you to the
Engage gaming floor. Going down a single flight takes you to the
basement entrance. Inside and ahead of the basement entrance is a 2m
by 5m (approx) irregularly-shaped room with section of glass bricks as
a vent/window to the upper-left. Inside and to the right of the
basement entrance, a short 3m x 1.5m (approx) corridor connects to a
5.5m x 3m (approx) main room with one far stone wall, the rest
plaster-boarded.

Points discussed with the business owner:
 - Rent: £300 / mnth inc. reasonable* Internet, water and reasonable*
electric use
 - Would be a sublease, we can have paperwork to suit our needs (From
rolling to N mth lease)
 - Business owner renews his 12month lease in July (early July we think)
 - We can redecorate
 - We can add our own street door lock for out-of-hours access
 - We can add power/data lines as needed
 - We can occupy early before renting for the move/decoration
 - There is less-secure understair storage between street door and
basement door, and a little
    more on the toilet/shower floor two flights up
 - local parking free from 8pm, paid parking at Denburn and streetside.

* = Internet can be metered but electric is not metered for basement at present.

Points discussed after visit by those present in the hacklab:
 - Seems viable in terms of space and cost
 - Would need to mitigate possible forced move risks (business might
move address etc) with
   some plan Bs
 - If viable, a lease start date from July after a June fitting/moving
might work.
 - Current space would need a fixup if we want deposit back

Directors are planning to visit a second time and will notify members
when a date is confirmed so members have an opportunity to view the
area also. We are currently aiming for April 17th.

Regards,
The 57North Board of Directors
