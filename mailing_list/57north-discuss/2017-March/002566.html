Subject: [57north-announce] 2017-03-21 Hackerspace Open Tuesday!

Today is open Tuesday at 57N and all are invited to come along after
7pm!

For those of you not in the know, Tuesday evenings are open to anyone
who wishes to come to 57North, Aberdeen's hackerspace[1]! We get up to a
range of activities on Tuesday nights, including but not limited to
social contact, programming, manufacturing weird things and consuming
sugary treats. 
We usually begin at about 7, but sometimes someone will be in earlier. 
If you're unsure, ask in IRC[2] or by email!

If you're new, I'd suggest you bring a laptop, and perhaps a project you
want to work on.

If you're coming in, feel free to reply and tell us all what you're
planning to do.

I'm going to talk loudly, hopefully fiddle with my new toy and continue
my QT based adventures!

Tonight I need to add QStrings and doubles to a QStandardItemModel in
c++ and export that to QML so I can use the data to populate a table and
place items on a map.

WOOOO!
