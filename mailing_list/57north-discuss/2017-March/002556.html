I'll be in. Probably looking at the technical side of dismembering
people since hub has changed and ID been added since we last did that.
Might get as far as looking at what's needed to get the videowall to
actually work for Ed Mini Maker Faire - but I've been saying that for a
couple of months already and haven't gotten very far yet.


And for anyone who hasn't made it onto Bruce's apparently
randomly generated distribution list for these announcements:
techmeetup is tomorrow.
