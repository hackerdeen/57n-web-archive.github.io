<PRE>Hi,

We talked about the team event Satrosphere (now the Aberdeen Science Centre) but it was on 10-Mar so we have missed it!
I was part of British Science Week 2017 not Mayfest.
It was &quot;Adult Takeover: Engineering Extravaganza&quot; see <A HREF="http://www.abdn.ac.uk/events/11054/">http://www.abdn.ac.uk/events/11054/</A>

The web site for the Mayfest is <A HREF="https://www.abdn.ac.uk/mayfestival/">https://www.abdn.ac.uk/mayfestival/</A>
...but it seems to be all about last year's event
....except it says this year's dates are 26th - 28th May 2017.

Regards,

Mike O'Hagan

Today is open Tuesday at 57N and all are invited to come along after
7pm!

For those of you not in the know, Tuesday evenings are open to anyone
who wishes to come to 57North, Aberdeen's hackerspace[1]! We get up to a
range of activities on Tuesday nights, including but not limited to
social contact, programming, manufacturing weird things and consuming
sugary treats.
We usually begin at about 7, but sometimes someone will be in earlier.
If you're unsure, ask in IRC[2]!

If you're new, I'd suggest you bring a laptop, and perhaps a project you
want to work on.

If you're coming in, feel free to reply and tell us all what you're
planning to do.

I'm going to talk loudly and continue trying to work out QT designer /
QT Creator, QT5, QML and seeing if I can remember C++.

Hooray!

Hx
