<PRE>I shall be playing with an Arduino Uno R3 clone I got in the post today.
Unfortunately I didn't get the Pt100 RTD sensor in time and haven't ordered
a humidity sensor yet. As I've nothing to breadboard I'll save myself the
bother of prising one of the breadboard sections I have off the console
enclosure it's on and just order a cheapo off ebay tonight.
I'll also be looking at sensors and Uno tutorials aimed at non-coders.

Frank ('Aman' (for some reason))

Subject: [57north-announce] It's Tuesday

It is again Tuesday - so the weekly space open evening is
tonight. Come along and work on projects, chat or drink irn-bru and
wonder why nothing works.

If you have specific plans let us know over on -discuss.

I think I'll be wiring up some control circuitry for blinken lights,
and possibly epoxying a case together if I can get all the bits ready
this afternoon.

Also, remember that the AGM is next week. If you want to stand to be a
director let us know then or before. If you want to join the meeting
remotely or appoint a proxy let us know before then. There might be
other things I'm forgetting that you might want to do before
then... read the announcement:
