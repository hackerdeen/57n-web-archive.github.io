<PRE>I think I'll be along. I upgraded the Ubuntu chroot on my Chromebook on Sunday from Trusty to Xenial. Perhaps my eyes were bigger than the HD partitions the script sets up when I was specifying the targets, as one is almost chock full. This may be the cause of some apps not launching from the GUI but I'll investigate other possible causes.

If I have any time, motivation or focus left, I'll be playing with the Arduino IDE and bits on loan from Ormiret and Sean.
I've been banging my head on the wall trying to get my Linux machine to see the Windows share on my Win 10 desktop. I didn't realise Microsoft had assigned me a Domain which I had to sign in with. I'll be looking for a laptop music player which can 
1 play music from my Win10 share without copying audio files to my eMMC 
2 serve up music from my Win 10 machine to my streamer renderer 
3 serve up music including internet-streamed music from my Ubuntu  machine to my streamer renderer 
4 play music in the system in the space.

Subject: [57north-announce] 2017-04-11 Open Tuesday

Today is open Tuesday at 57N and all are invited to come along after
7pm!

For those of you not in the know, Tuesday evenings are open to anyone
who wishes to come to 57North, Aberdeen's hackerspace[1]! We get up to a
range of activities on Tuesday nights, including but not limited to
social contact, programming, manufacturing weird things and consuming
sugary treats. 
We usually begin at about 7, but sometimes someone will be in earlier. 
If you're unsure, ask in IRC[2]!

If you're new, I'd suggest you bring a laptop, and perhaps a project you
want to work on.

If you're coming in, feel free to reply and tell us all what you're
planning to do.

I will be doing Debian, doing shouting at raspberry pis and doing a
range of other activities.
