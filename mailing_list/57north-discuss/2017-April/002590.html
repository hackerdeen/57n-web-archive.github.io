<PRE>I'll be along tonight.
If there's a T10 security Torx TR /hexalobular internal TR/ Torx Plus TRldriver in the space I'll be disassembling, inspecting and testing the 18650 Li cells in a Makita 1830 battery pack which failed on me on Sunday. I lost track of time and when I had last charged it and in haste used it on low charge. If I can find a CC source I'll try and get any cells with low charge up to a stage wher the charger will accept them. I'll poke around at the protection PCB and google component IDs for hack potential. The PCB can set a flag to the charger not to charge the pack which isn't reset even after cell replacement. I'm waiting for a parcel so unable to get to Gibby[']s['] tool shop for a driver.

I need to 3D print something from someone's public Onshape file. Has a means of cost allocation and payment for filament and use of the machine been established?

I've a 9V NiMH battery case to epoxy so will be schnorring a dab or three of the epoxy Ormiret is mixing.

I'll be trying to remember what projects I had thought of but allowed myself to be distracted from for over a year. Maybe time to see a proper GP for an Rx of methylphenidate or modenafil*.  

Else I'll be drinking cheap coffee from my Thermos, eating potato crisps from the tucker and fiddling with an Arduino, NodeMCU and temperature sensor.
*OTOH maybe it's all the coffee.

To answer one of your rhetorical questions in a reductionist manner, it's more likely to have snow this time of year (in the presence of polar / Siberian wind and the polar Jetstream being at low latitude) than the end of December because of a longer period of low sunlight 
Then there's Climate Disruption widely regarded by the vast majority of climate scientists to be anthropogenic caused by human consumption habits:

Reliance on Motor vehicles, air transport, shipping
Reliance on heating and refrigeration (134a GWP= 3800)
Tat manufacture
Urbanisation
Peat bog desctruction 
Deforestation
Loss of habitat (IIRC particularly from c3/c4 grasses) to agriculture 
Livestock production  leading to exchange of Alkanes (C2H4 GWP 72)
Agricultural methods leading to exchange of Hippy crack (GWP c. 290)
Arc Quenchers SF6 (GWP <A HREF="http://lists.57north.co/listinfo/57north-discuss">32,000 at 500</A> years)
Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.
Not in any real order
What would it be like without rhetorical questions?

Morning friends!
Oh my goodness,  it's the end of April! How did that happen?

Why is it snowing? What direction is up? Is the earth flat?

Find out the answers to these questions and more at 57North tonight!

Today is open Tuesday at 57N and all are invited to come along after
7pm!

For those of you not in the know, Tuesday evenings are open to anyone
who wishes to come to 57North, Aberdeen's hackerspace[1]! We get up to a
range of activities on Tuesday nights, including but not limited to
social contact, programming, manufacturing weird things and consuming
sugary treats. 
We usually begin at about 7, but sometimes someone will be in earlier. 
If you're unsure, ask in IRC[2]!

If you're new, I'd suggest you bring a laptop, and perhaps a project you
want to work on.

If you're coming in, feel free to reply and tell us all what you're
planning to do!

I will be fiddling with vagrant, gns3, VMs in general and muttering
about that time I bought Avon products from yer da.
