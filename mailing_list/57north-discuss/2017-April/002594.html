<PRE>GNU Social and Mastodon both use the same OStatus protocol, as far as
I'm aware, and are interoperable. However, Mastodon is near-unusable
for a variety of reasons - including that federation is very, very
broken. Quoting someone in a discussion room earlier today:

&gt;<i> Mastodon only federates posts from people someone on your instance follows. This causes funny things like: you can't see replies, likes, retoots or such to people you follow from other instances if someone on your instance doesn't follow the person who posted the reply.
</I>
It also never fetches history - if your server ever goes down, you'll
miss messages forever. I don't know if GNU Social suffers the same
problems, but being based on OStatus, I wouldn't doubt it.

I don't believe any of these systems are likely to be useful in the
near future - I have a number of people who have recently tried
Mastodon and given up on it within a week due to the issues, and GNU
Social is essentially a maintenance project that was already dead
before GNU picked it up.

&gt;<i> Hi All,

</I>&gt;<i> Looking at the GNU Social instance, this hasn't been used in ~6 months. Now
