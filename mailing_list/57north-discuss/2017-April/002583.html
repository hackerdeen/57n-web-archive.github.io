Rebooting the UK Hackspace Foundation
 
Hello!
 
Appologies if you've already recieved this email, we had some sending issues which have meant that not everyone on our list actually got the email. As we're not 100% sure who got it and who didn't we're resending to everyone. Don't worry, this is the only time this will happen.
 
If you have had this email already but haven't yet responded to our [ inaugural survey ]( <A HREF="http://zkfc.r.ah.d.sendibm4.com/21wmlca9wbd.html">http://zkfc.r.ah.d.sendibm4.com/21wmlca9wbd.html</A> ) please please please take a few minutes of your time to do so. We're watching the responses closely and will be using the results to target our inital actions.
 
We’re contacting you, along with all other Hackspaces in the UK, to:
Bring you up to speed on the formation and plans for the UK Hackspace Foundation Determine your spaces level of interest in joining the foundation
 
So... what’s been occurring?
 
Since late 2016 a group of ~30 directors/trustees from UK Hackspaces have been working to establish the UK Hackspace Foundation (UKHSF) as a legal entity and lay the groundwork for accepting/supporting member spaces.
 
The UKHSF was incorporated on the 9th Jan and we’re currently preparing to accept member applications whilst developing supporting resources in parallel (e.g. advice/information on running a space, discounts from common suppliers). Like many hackspaces, the UKHSF is a voluntary not-for-profit co-operative with a small board of directors and a membership made up of hackspaces (Member Spaces) and individuals (Supporter Members).
 
What’s the UKHSF going to do?

Although many aspects of the UKHSF are still a work in progress, the high level mission of the UKHSF is to promote and support community co-operative workshops (hackspaces, makerspaces, etc) which encourage technical, scientific, and artistic skills through social collaboration and education. The nominal membership fees will be reinvested in support of that mission.
 
Exactly how that mission is brought to life will be decided by the members, but will include:
Compiling advice/information on forming and running a hackspace, including case studies Negotiating discounts on common services and suppliers (e.g. insurance, equipment, materials) Providing focused support for new/struggling spaces - both in terms of skills/time as well as potential for funding
 
Who can join?

Hackspaces can apply to join if they meet the UKHSF’s [ definition of a Hackspace ]( <A HREF="http://zkfc.r.ah.d.sendibm4.com/21wndsa9wbd.html">http://zkfc.r.ah.d.sendibm4.com/21wndsa9wbd.html</A> ). Individuals can also apply for membership, as long as they are not acting as a representative of a Member Space. Part of becoming a member will entail agreeing to an over-arching [ Code of Conduct ]( <A HREF="http://zkfc.r.ah.d.sendibm4.com/21wo68a9wbd.html">http://zkfc.r.ah.d.sendibm4.com/21wo68a9wbd.html</A> ), one of many useful assets that may be borrowed/built-upon by other spaces.
 
[ See here for more information ]( <A HREF="http://zkfc.r.ah.d.sendibm4.com/21woyoa9wbd.html">http://zkfc.r.ah.d.sendibm4.com/21woyoa9wbd.html</A> ).
 
Interested in joining?
 
Whilst we hammer out membership details and other infrastructure, we’d like to gauge your space’s level of interest in joining the UKHSF and whether we’ve got our priorities right!

To that end, we’d appreciate it if you could complete this [ quick survey ]( <A HREF="http://zkfc.r.ah.d.sendibm4.com/21wpr4a9wbd.html">http://zkfc.r.ah.d.sendibm4.com/21wpr4a9wbd.html</A> ).
 
Itching to get involved?

[ Join the discussion on the new forum ]( <A HREF="http://zkfc.r.ah.d.sendibm4.com/21wqjka9wbd.html">http://zkfc.r.ah.d.sendibm4.com/21wqjka9wbd.html</A> ) - let us know what you’d like the UKHSF to focus on and/or what support you could offer.
 
What next?
 
Over the next few weeks we’ll be:
Collating/reviewing replies to the survey Finalising key material like membership details, hackspace definition, etc Ensuring critical foundation infrastructure is in place (e.g. bank account)
 
We’re aiming to start accepting membership applications soon will be in touch again to let you know as soon as that’s possible.
 
Kind regards

The fledgling UKHSF
