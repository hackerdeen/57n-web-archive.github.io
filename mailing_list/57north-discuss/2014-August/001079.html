If there is going to be somebody there, could they email me
directly, please, as the &quot;digest&quot; only comes through to me the
day after everybody has posted.  Ta.  I hope to see you later,
if all works out.  (And some directions might be useful!)





I was thinking about heading in this evening, a new person
wanting to come visit  is enough impetus to make the decision.
I'll aim for being in by 19:00 (but could come down earlier if
you'd prefer).



The space is at 35A Union street. Opposite &quot;Jamie's Italian&quot;
and above  a 24 hour shop. We're on the 3rd floor.



There is a phone in the space: 01224 583491 Give it a call if
you can't find the space, or the front door is locked (other
folks from the building sometimes lock it on their way out).
