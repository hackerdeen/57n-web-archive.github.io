On top of yourself I know me and Iain are going. Hibby is talking about coming.

I still don't have travel sorted, thats mostly because the university is in
farce mode.

Right now my travel plans are:

1) 	Get a uni hire 
2) 	Jump on Hibby's insurance and share the driving
3) 	Take the adventuremobile and hope that if it does break down it is on the
	way home

</I>
I don't think I could manage the train with the amount of equipment I have to
take. Also I already have a parking ticket and feel the need to use it.

Once we get to EMF I have two and a half plans.

1)		Stream video of talks
2)		Make club mate(adventuremate) and give it away
2.5)	Acquire a folding bike, hack it in some way with LED's and wifi. 

I still need to find a folding bike, though I can't say I have been trying very
hard.
