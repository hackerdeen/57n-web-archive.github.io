Hmm, I've done some poking and hackhub is definitely supposed to be
checking the right thing [1]. 

What it's checking currently returns True for Enterobsidian. That check
returning False is the only reason you should get the message that you
have to pay. Only possibilities I can think of for how you would manage
to get that message today would be if it was being cached somewhere (I'm
pretty sure it's not being cached by hackhub - things between there and
your device are unfortunately outside my control[2]) or you're (or
rather whatever device you were using is) logged in as someone else. 

I guess grab me next time you're at the space (or anybody is at the
space, so it's OK to be unlocking the door) and I can try adding some
debug output to see what's going wrong. 

If anybody else is seeing this message when they think they shouldn't
please speak up: more data points might point to what's going wrong. 

If anybody else wants to have a look at the code they should speak up
too[3]. All bugs are shallow with enough eyes etc.

[1] For certain values of right: it checks if the user has a recorded
payment for either of the last two months. This isn't the correct
definition of member according to our articles of assocition, but surely
nobody believes anything written in the articles...

[2] Come the revolution...

[3] This is my umpteenth reminder that I should really get this code
published...
