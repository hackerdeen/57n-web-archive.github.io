Hi, Tom.

I'm hoping to get the rest of the scrap servers from Petrotechnics
today. I'll spend the evening looking at what we've got. However, the
more I think about it, the more I believe we would be better off just
repairing the Opteron 200 systems that I donated instead. I've already
got replacement motherboards for them...

I thought some of the Xeons in the scrap servers from Petrotechnics
would support VT-x and might be more useful than the Opteron 200's that
I donated, which don't support AMD-V. However, the small amount of RAM
in the Xeon servers and the small, ancient SCSI disks in most of them,
make me think that it's not worth investing time trying to use them.

I'm not bringing my Parallella kit tonight, because I want to have a
proper look at these scrap servers and decide what to do with them. I'll
post an inventory here so we can decide collectively what to do.

Bye,

  Tony.
