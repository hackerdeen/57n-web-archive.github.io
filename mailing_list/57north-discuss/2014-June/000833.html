<PRE>Flying from the rig to shore in Gabon today. Next week.
I'll try to remember lead-acid batteries for the UPS and bits for the geiger counter PSU.

For next week, is there someone with experience in 3d design and printing? I don't know how long it'll take to get the PSU for the Geiger counter working (or indeed, if the Geiger counter itself works, it needs a PSU!), but designing a case for holding the PSU in the form factor for the original 120V dry battery can probably proceed independently.

Hi,

If all has gone to plan, the sun will rise in the next few hours (it may
already have by the time you read this) and then it will be Tuesday.

This means cryptonoise from 5pm to 7pm at the Illicit Still (note the new
location) for those interested and then on to the hackerspace for hacking.

I will be working on my network path sanity tester. If you'll also be
working on a project, or are not working on a project but coming along
anyway, let the list know.

Iain.
