Can confirm announce is setup to reply to discuss and has been since I
took on moderation of the lists from Iain.

We thought this was yahoo playing silly-beans, but perhaps it's
something else. It looks like altered reply-to (so called header
munging) does not apply to digest reply-to headers by design. Can
anyone on digest confirm this?

Cheers,
Ed
