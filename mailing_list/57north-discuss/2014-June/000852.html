<PRE>At/around the AGM we pencilled in to have the EGM to fix things we've
done wrong at the start of July (I had it in my head we were aiming for
the 2nd but the 1st is the Tuesday...). 

To do that we need to send out the announcement 14 clear days before
which I make as about Monday next week. 

Things I can remember that need to be on the agenda:

 - Dismemberment off people we haven't seen in a while. 

 - Swapping treasurer

 - Fixing things in the articles. 

The dismemberment and fixing the articles need things done before the
announcement can go out: getting list of members to be dismembered and
getting in touch with them; and figuring out what actually needs changed
with the articles. I probably won't have time to look at either before
Monday. 

How about going for an EGM on 8th of July? That gives us a little over a
week to sort out the agenda for it and get the announcement out.

Robert
