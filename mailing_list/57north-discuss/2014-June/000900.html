<PRE>When I got to the lab this afternoon there was a puddle between the
fridge and the main table. The ice that was in the fridge was melting
and leaking out. I've moved the ice to the sink - if anyone is in in the
near future some of it might still be ice...

Since I had the mop out anyway to clear up the puddle I gave the rest of
the floor[1] a bit of a mop. It was actually in a fair state. If I was
the last person to mop it then that was a couple of months ago. I think
it would be a good idea to clean the floor every couple of weeks: anyone
want to volunteer to do it next, then ping the list when you do and
someone else can volunteer for the next turn, and so on, and so on to a
wonderfully clean space for all time...

Robert

[1] Not really the rest of the floor, just the bit in the middle
accessible without moving too much furniture.
