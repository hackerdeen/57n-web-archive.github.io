We'd love to invite you to the event below.


We would love to hear from you, event details below.


<A HREF="http://rewiredstate.org/event/end-of-the-world-hack.php">http://rewiredstate.org/event/end-of-the-world-hack.php</A>


In 2012 the Earth could have undergone a catastrophic transformation by way of
a solar flare. This devastating event could have destroyed most of the earth
communications and energy distribution networks. Disruption and in some cases
destruction of public services, food distribution and medical supplies would
have been inevitable. It would have simply been chaos in a matter of weeks if
not days days as there would no means of government or organisation to
coordinate supplies and people.

Our very future would have been radically altered through a period of disorder
while the human race re-learns to access pre-electric technologies and skills
long forgotten while it comes to terms with this technological setback. We
would have been pre-industrial once again, however this time we have the
additional problems of the modern world with is massive population and its way
of life dependant on electronic technologies.
What is even more interesting about this information, is that it has has only
just come to light through analysis of collected data. It was simply the case
that the Earth was in the right place at the right time to avoid it.


 The Scenario

We know the earth is about to be bombarded with solar flares and magnetic
storms of varying ferocity on July 4th, 5th and 6th 2014, by which time the
infrastructure of the energy and communications networks will have been
completely decimated across the entire planet.

You have 48 hours to best prepare the human race for survival, through the
chaos, and on to a successful future. After which time there will be no
electricity and no electronic technologies available.

You can utilise existing technologies during the 36 hours, however the quality
and extent of these services will diminish during this period as the earths
communication and energy infrastructure will come into contact with solar
flares and magnetic storms destroying their capabilities.Once the 48 hour
period is complete, all &quot;new&quot; technologies must be able to be utilised with no
electricity.

You have 48 hours to use your technological skills and prepare the human race
for a successful future, what will you do? Will the geeks inherit the earth?


   Prize categories

 * &quot;L(W)MOE Award&quot; (Last Man or Woman on earth) for the most selfish
   and self-sustaining technology.
 * &quot;Vintage Award&quot; for the best use of &quot;wood&quot; and other naturally
   occurring local &quot;technologies&quot;. Ironmongery also welcome.
 * &quot;To the wire Award&quot; the best &quot;new&quot; technology that used cutting edge
   technology to create it.
 * &quot;Might as well laugh Award&quot; for the most amusing, yet useful technology.
 * &quot;First (end-of-the) World Problems Award&quot; for the technology that
   best deals with problems that will arise suddenly for a humanity
   dependent on electricity.
 * &quot;Stick Together Award&quot; for the most selfless and community driven
   technology.
 * &quot;True Hero Award&quot; the best overall technology developed at the hack day.


   Rules

1. Electronic Technology can be used to present hack, but not be part of the
actual hack itself.
