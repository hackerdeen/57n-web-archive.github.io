<PRE>Sup,

We are going to start having a weekly event on Thursday evenings.

Here is the proposed schedule (please object if we've signed you up for
running an event that you'd be busy for or don't think you can run):

Feb 27th - Minecraft Club (irl)
Mar  6th - Board Game Night (adventureloop)
Mar 13th - Lock Sport Night (tony)
Mar 20th - Robot Fight Club (adventureloop)
Mar 27th - Radio Night (enterobsidian)
Apr  3rd - GPS Alamanac (adventureloop)
Apr 10th - Retro Night (irl)

Event Details
=============

Minecraft Club
--------------

You will play Minecraft. We will set up a local server to allow for
those that have not purchased Minecraft to participate and will upload
the world to our online server after the event. We will build beautiful
things.

Board Game Night
----------------

A selection of board games will be available in the space for us to
play. Tom will direct this.

Lock Sport Night
----------------

Tony will tell us how to pick locks. (Tony - Can you confirm this and
send me some blurb?)

Robot Fight Club
----------------

Learn some technologies that can be used to create killer robots and
practice your skills in a virtual arena.

Radio Night
-----------

Learn about two-way radio communication and potentially talk to people
at AARS (if Callum has the correct license so people can use the radio
under his supervision). Callum - Can you confirm this and send me a
blurb of what you would like to do?

GPS Almanac
-----------

Learn about GPS to control things from space. Potentially, things about
OpenStreetMap.

Retro Night
-----------

Lots of retro computing. You'll notice as the list of these went on,
they got a bit vague.

If anyone else wants to run a Themed Thursday, speak up on the list.

If anyone has any problems, speak up on the list.

Iain.
