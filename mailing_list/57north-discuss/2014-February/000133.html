<PRE>We are a COMPANY!!! Quick everyone put on a suit and grab a cigar, we can discuss the downfall of the empire. 

Tuesday is 57 North's weekly open night. This week we have some serious business to discuss, as we do once a month. The main item is the formation of the company, hopefully we will have conformations by the evening. There doesn't seem to be an agenda together. That should mean the meeting will be quick, only covering the actions from last month.

Other than that there will be general hacking. With Ed needing help putting together his pixels for the workshop.

Any members planning on working on something should reply to the list and let everyone know about your cool project.

Events coming up:
	1. 	Cryptopary: Scared in this modern world of government spying? Come to our crypto party on saturday and 
		learn how to protect your self.
		This Saturday, 22nd Feb
		<A HREF="http://57north.co/wiki/Cryptoparty">http://57north.co/wiki/Cryptoparty</A>
	2.	Like minecraft or just like digging holes? Come along to our first Thursday event where we will have a
		minecraft night.
		More details to come or contact Iain Learmonth(<A HREF="http://lists.57north.co/listinfo/57north-discuss">irl at fsfe.org</A>)


P.S.	I might not be in tonight, I am still unsure of my plans.
