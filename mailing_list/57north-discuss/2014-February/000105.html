&gt;<i> Iain et al,
</I>&gt;<i> I was led to believe that the third Thursday was the HSE exempt &quot;At Risk&quot; night. Can we clarify what the standing is on this one?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
The &quot;At Risk&quot; night thing did come up, but so far there hasn't been a
request for one. Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays are still available for
&quot;At Risk&quot; nights by request on the mailing list.

&gt;<i> I'm not sure when I'm next back in Aberdeen. It could be anywhere between the end of next week and 6 weeks from now, possibly longer. It would probably be advisable to have a back up event should any of us not be able to make it.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
Would you be able to confirm closer to the time? How close to the time
would it need to be?

We can have Michael as a back up to do a talk on SDR.

&gt;<i> My licence only covers use of the radio by unlicenced users at a registered club address and only if they are studying for their Foundation, neither of which is applicable. I can however, assuming anyone is on, do a live demonstration. I may also be able to do a workshop on technical drawing, eg blueprints and circuit diagrams, if there is more demand for that. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I thought so. As it's a Thursday, I guess AARS will have someone OTA at
some point. We could do some co-ordination there. Do they still have the
1pm net? I don't feel like walking down to the Scout Hut as it's a bit
too far.

I've got a 2 meter handheld, a crystal based 2m/70cm set and the
TrunkTracker. Do you have anything a bit more serious?

Iain.
