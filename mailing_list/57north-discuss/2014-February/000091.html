I should point out, the &quot;bad&quot; machines haven't been deemed to be bad
yet, they just failed a quick visual inspection. I believe it may just
need some power for a bit to get the CMOS battery up and then they'll boot.

I would like to parallelogramise tdpw. No IPC would be needed between
processes but a remote fork mechanism is necessary.

&gt;<i> 2. What OS should we use?

FreeBSD would not prevent me from achieving my task. There is a Debian
GNU/kFreeBSD that we might look at if there is a FreeBSD based
clustering solution, just because we hate our lives and hacking on that
would make us want to live no more.

&gt;<i> 3. What task distribution libs/programming tools do we need.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I believe Tony would be the expert here. There's a few frameworks for
writing parallelograms.

Iain.

P.S. I would like parallelogram to catch on as a new word for describing
highly parellelised programs.
