<PRE>I'd be in favour of any that support online banking, with a 2nd multifactor
device (e.g. the devices you plug a card into &amp; generate a one time code,
as opposed to a 2nd passphrase, which asks for 1st, 3rd &amp; 9th character
etc) as this would allow us to (roughly) enforce the rule that 2 directors
needed to action transactions.

e.g. We could have 2 x multifactor devices &amp; 2 cards for the account (each
held by a single director) then the remaining 3 directors could know the
password for the account.  This isn't perfect*, as it is possible that the
only 2 directors authorising payment both have either the password, or both
have the multifactor - in that case, they'd need to go to a branch, where
we setup that 2 signatures required, with all 5 directors enrolled.

The alternative is that every director has full financial access (not ideal
/ against articles) or we only use branch access (which is less convenient
than above)

Thoughts?

Tony

Workings:

*
Assuming only 2 directors present 4 permutations fail, 6 permutations
succeed
Assuming only 3 directors present 1 permutation fails, 9 permutations
succeed

total 5 failures permutations, 15 successes

(1 director always fails - as intended, 4+ directors always succeed -
excluded from results)

my 5 min maths check (corrections welcome)
