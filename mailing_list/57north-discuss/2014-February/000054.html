I agree this should be changed, and no one has spoken against it, so we
can just do that. We'll pretend this email serves as you actually having
done the change as everyone will have seen it.

&gt;<i> Also there is still the clause &quot;A person who has served on the board for
</I>&gt;<i> a period of 3 years shall automatically vacate office on expiry of that
</I>&gt;<i> 3 year period.&quot; I thought we decided to remove that one?
</I>&gt;<i>

Do we have the provision for people standing down for re-election
automatically? As long as we have that, we don't need that one.

Iain.
