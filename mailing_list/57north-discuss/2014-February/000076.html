Hi, Iain.

Thanks to you, Carl and everyone else who lugged the 2U servers and
switches etc. out of my car last night. Sorry I didn't hang around
afterwards - I was worried about getting a parking ticket!

I'll bring some SATA disks along next week and help you to check the
systems out. They are all dual Opteron 200's with 8GiB RAM, but half are
dual-core and half are single-core. The servers should boot OK from the
Minke Informatics USB-sticks I gave you of you want to test them.

I might be able to lay my hands on some 19&quot; rack nuts and bolts if you
need them to put the servers in your new rack?

Bye,

  Tony.
