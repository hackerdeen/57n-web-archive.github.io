<PRE>Morning All,

Once, again it is Tuesday. 57North&#8217;s open slash drink a lot of beer night. Each Tuesday we open up the space to anyone that wants to come a long. Members also come in and we have the best night of the week.

Any members heading in tonight should reply to this email and let everyone know what they are planning on getting up to.

Tonight I will be playing with some cherry switches, or one of the other 100 ideas I have on the go right now.


The space has a few events coming up.

Minecraft night: Want to play some mine craft?? Playing across the internet annoying? Well come into the space, we are going to localise the mine craft server and play on our gigabit network.
Contact <A HREF="http://lists.57north.co/listinfo/57north-discuss">irl at fsfe.org</A> for more info.
This Thursday the 27 Feb.


Tom
