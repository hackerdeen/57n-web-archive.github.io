<PRE>Iain et al,
I was led to believe that the third Thursday was the HSE exempt &quot;At Risk&quot; night. Can we clarify what the standing is on this one?

I'm not sure when I'm next back in Aberdeen. It could be anywhere between the end of next week and 6 weeks from now, possibly longer. It would probably be advisable to have a back up event should any of us not be able to make it.

My licence only covers use of the radio by unlicenced users at a registered club address and only if they are studying for their Foundation, neither of which is applicable. I can however, assuming anyone is on, do a live demonstration. I may also be able to do a workshop on technical drawing, eg blueprints and circuit diagrams, if there is more demand for that. 

Let me know how we wish to proceed.

This is a NSA and GCHQ proof email - Content so boring that no one will read it.

 
Radio Night
-----------
 
Learn about two-way radio communication and potentially talk to people
at AARS (if Callum has the correct license so people can use the radio
under his supervision). Callum - Can you confirm this and send me a
blurb of what you would like to do?
 
GPS Almanac
-----------
 
Learn about GPS to control things from space. Potentially, things about
OpenStreetMap.
 
Retro Night
-----------
 
Lots of retro computing. You'll notice as the list of these went on,
they got a bit vague.
 
If anyone else wants to run a Themed Thursday, speak up on the list.
 
If anyone has any problems, speak up on the list.
 
Iain.
