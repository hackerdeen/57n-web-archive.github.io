Hi, Ed.

You're right, but apparently kids can like their profile to a 'parent's 
account, which someone (presumably masquerading as a child) has done to 
my account twice now... As I've said on IRC, I've changed my password 
three times and set TFA on the account now, and reported it to the BBC.

Just concerned that someone/thing has been able to link a profile to 
mine without an email being sent to the address assosciated with my 
account. However, Shell is right that iff my email account has been 
intercepted someone could snarf the relevant messages and approve the 
link but that is really descending into paranoid conspiracy theory and I 
don't consider it a very likely explanation.

Thanks <A HREF="http://lists.57north.co/listinfo/57north-discuss">all at 57North</A> for your thoughts!

   Tony.
