<PRE>Hi Rob,

I think this would be an excellent use of the space. It's also a good test to see how well the space works for different types of events.

If they want to do this regularly, I think this would also be fine, assuming they are always accompanied by a member. We would probably ask the organisers to become members if it were recurring.

As the space is larger now, I think it's OK to see the space as another tool you can use for your projects, and those projects could be events.

Please do make sure everyone is checking in with the checking in QR codes. You can also manually type the URL.

The Wifi QR codes are wrong (wrong SSID), I'll try to get new ones printed up before the event.

Thanks,
Iain.

(I did not confer with other directors on this, so these are just my views.)
