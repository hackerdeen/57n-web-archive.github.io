<PRE>Hey folks,

Tuesday again?  Last time I checked my watch, it was still weekend.

I will pop in today as well, to play with a switch controlled by the
Raspberry Pi, or an ESP

Cheerio,
W

&gt;<i> Hi All,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Aberdeen City remains at protection level FRUBES &amp; GO-GURT, which means we
</I>&gt;<i> can invite all interested to today's OPEN TUESDAY. We typically start
</I>&gt;<i> around 7pm and remain at our location in Unit H, Kettock Lodge, Campus Two,
</I>&gt;<i> Innovation Park, AB22 8GU.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'll be in around 7pm or so, faffing with a 3d printer and then being
</I>&gt;<i> social!
</I>&gt;<i> Both the SLA and the FDM printers are up and running, and *just about* at
</I>&gt;<i> the point where you can import a model and press print!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> SLA will need a little longer to work on - we need an IPA bath to clean
</I>&gt;<i> off parts and a UV chamber to cure the resin. Midder's had a good idea for
</I>&gt;<i> the UV chamber, so i guess I just need to buy a bucket and 5l of IPA!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you're coming in today, consider sending a reply!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Now begins the important COVID information transmission, please pay
</I>&gt;<i> attention:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We are participating in the Scottish Government's contact tracing
</I>&gt;<i> programme. You will find purple posters at the entrance to the space and
</I>&gt;<i> around the space that contain QR codes. Please scan the QR code and provide
</I>&gt;<i> your contact details. If you are unable to scan a QR code, there is a link
</I>&gt;<i> to type into your browser. If you cannot use the link, ask someone else to
</I>&gt;<i> check in for you and provide them with your email address and phone number.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please note that contact tracing is a requirement of participating in an
</I>&gt;<i> Open Tuesday in person, and is not negotiable. If you do not provide
</I>&gt;<i> tracing details you will be asked to leave.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As we emerge from this global disaster, some will understandably be
</I>&gt;<i> cautious about being in new spaces. Please respect people's boundaries by
</I>&gt;<i> maintaining social distancing and wearing a mask as you move around the
</I>&gt;<i> space. If you are sat down, you can take off your mask to have easier
</I>&gt;<i> access to your face if needed for eating or drinking. Use common sense and
</I>&gt;<i> remember this is a shared space.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As this event is open to the public, the wearing of a face covering while
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;not seated, eating or drinking&quot; is a LEGAL REQUIREMENT.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you are in early, open windows to get air flowing through the space. It
</I>&gt;<i> could be a good idea to bring a jumper or something as the space could be a
</I>&gt;<i> little cooler than you might expect because of this.
