<PRE>Hi all

Hopefully all saw the email below when it went out in July. Since
then, members have been looking at possible spaces to relocate to with
the results written up in the wiki [1]. Please have a look at this and
let the list know what you think. Some early viewings have already
taken place (Union Terrace Gardens - video recording available on
wiki, Kettock Lodge) and I am hoping to arrange at least one follow-up
viewing of a location next week (Kettock Lodge). I will update when I
know more but would like to hear from members interested in viewing
also.

As with Kev's email before, if you have any questions on our
relocation drive, just respond to the discuss list so anyone can see
our discussion, or come in on a Tuesday. I'll endeavour to send any
major points spoken on our Tuesday gathering (when I am present) on
the discuss list but cannot guarantee I'll capture everything
mentioned.

Cheers,
Ed

Hello Everyone.

Some of you may be aware of the building we are currently in being
available for all enquiries, this is due to, as far as we know, the
property having been sold. There is also a rent increase which cannot
be met by our current membership and membership rate, It appears the
landlord has an interest in the building being empty, either way, it
may not be viable to stay.

The gaming cafe concern who we sublet from, soon to be called Reset
Aberdeen, was also sold and they seem to be interested in moving.

This has been discussed by some of the membership, at the Openday and
at other times. So what does this mean, and why should you be
interested?

It means we are looking for a new location, so we would like to hear
from anyone who knows of a suitable location which we could use, if
the property is too big for us we can also approach the gaming cafe,
and potentially fill a space which we could both share.

This will be a developing situation and we may not have a lot of time
to arrange this, we have a rolling agreement till the end of
September, by which time we should ideally have found a suitable
location.

Any questions you may have, we will endeavour to answer, respond to
the discuss list, so anyone can see our discussion, or come in on a
Tuesday.

We have moved before and we can do it again, so this could be an
opportunity, to find an even better location for our community.

Mull this over while you enjoy the fine weather we are having.

Midder.
