<PRE> 1. *Your Name (nick):*

 Wouter Piessens (Walter if my first name is too challenging)

 2. *Your Background*

 Born in Belgium, native Flemish speaker, meteorologist by hobby and
trade, settled in Scotland in 2010 after having tested a few other
nations with varying success. I have always had a bit of tech
interest, but never really went further than building computers and
designing websites. A complex knee injury earlier this year forced me
to reduce mobility for a good few months, and find indoor hobbies: So
I bought a Raspberry Pi and started learning python.

 3. *Your Hacklab-related Interests*

I am man of projects. I like designing lamps, furniture, weather
monitoring. Now working on bigger project to build a professional
weather station, and display output it screens integrated into
furniture)

 4. *What knowledge can you bring hacklab community?*

A bit of python, but mostly professional knowledge about meteorology
and climatology.  I can also teach you Flemish and a few continental
languages, including gibberish  :-)

 5. *What do you wish to learn from the hacklab community?*

Learn more about electronics and get inspiration for new projects

 6. *Link to photo (not essential but useful)*
