<PRE>Hello everyone,

My adventure here in Aberdeen is nearing its end, and I have a ton of
stuff that I either don't need anymore or aren't worth taking back with
me to the Netherlands. I realise this isn't a classified ad website, but
I figured that some of these things might interest you. I'm not looking
to get much for it, but it would be nice to recoup some of my losses and
not having to throw this away.

Here's a list of everything that I wasn't planning on taking back with
me:

   - 12V 7Ah sealed lead acid battery
         Perfect for portable radio operations.
   - 12V battery charger
         Used it for the above battery, but should work with any 12V battery
         really.
   - 2m coaxial dipole antenna
         By now most of you will know these potplant antennas.
   - Magnetic loop antenna
         Made dozens of contacts on it with low power (10W), good for
         indoor use. Covers 15m to 80m, but efficiency will be best for
         15m to 30m. Can be disassembled for portable use.
   - Camping chair
   - Thermos ThermoCafe 1.0L
   - Plastic drawers
         The small drawer cabinets that you see at B&amp;Q and Asda. Has four
         drawers.
   - TP-Link TL-WR841ND router
         Well supported by OpenWRT and easy to flash. Currently runs a custom
         image that contains the required OpenVPN tools to tunnel all trafic
         over a VPN connection.
   - Logitech Z213 2.1 speaker set
         Small but decent speaker set. The subwoofer has a perfect height for
         putting your monitor on top.
   - Weller SP25NK soldering iron
         Entry-level Weller iron at 25 watts. The low power makes it
         better at soldering (components not as likely to be damaged) than
         desoldering.

If you're even vaguely interested in any of these items, hit me up with
an offer and I'm sure we'll work it out. Again, I don't need much for it
but at least something would be nice. I'd hate to have to throw these
things away.

Best regards,
Derecho

P.S.: I plan on coming to the space tonight, so I might be able to bring
something off this list with me.
