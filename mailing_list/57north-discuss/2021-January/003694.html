<PRE>Hey Nerds.

Let's play some games on Friday. 

I suggest Among Us[1] (Windows/Wine [steam/epic/msft store], iOS, Android) on Friday to sow the seeds of distrust amongst the community.  It's cheap (&lt;Â£5) and after a simple explanation and attempt, you might even get the hang of it.

If anyone has any jackbox[2] games we can drink and be stupid. They're akin to TV gameshows - watch the stream, participate with phone/tablet/PC and trash talk each other. This can easy happen on Friday too, I have pack #3. It gets better the more you drink and has memetastic ads.[4]

Also, in more &quot;niche appeal&quot;, online multiplayer OpenTTD[3], and  build some ridiculous train networks or something. This will need setting up a server somewhere, so Friday is unfeasable.
