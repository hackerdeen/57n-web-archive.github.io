<PRE>Hello Hackers,

It pretty clear to me that this cycle of lock up lock down is going to
continue for the next few years. Rather than dispersing slowly I think
we should make a deliberate effort to do at least one thing each month.

I don't know what we should do and I am not gong to organise all the
things, I think you as a member are a great source for ideas. Lets share
ideas for virtual things we can do and then figure out where there is
weight of interest to organise around.

Virtual meetings are going to be the mode, but we can arrange to have a
variety of different topics activities and forms for them. Once we
accept that we won't be in the space on Tuesdays we can start to figure
out fun and crazy ideas to implement.

I look forward to hearing your ideas and seeing what plans we can come
up with to make them happen.

--

This is of course on top of our twice weekly mumble calls that have been
running without fail since March 2020. The next mumble call is tonight,
you should join us.

- Tom
</PRE>
