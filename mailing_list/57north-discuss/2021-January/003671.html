</I>&gt;<i> For space contributing some of the cost: I think £33.75 each is cheap enough to not bother with the minefield of &quot;Should we be spending collective money on something only a subset want?&quot; to reduce it. But on the other hand I'm happy to pay less if someone else wants to do the arguing that the space should fund some of it.

That works for me, let me know how to get money to you
