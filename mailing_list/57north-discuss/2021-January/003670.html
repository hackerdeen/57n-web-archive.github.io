Hi, Rob.

OK, count me in - PM me a PayPal email or Bank account I can pay you with.

&gt;<i> For case: I like the plan of printing one ourselves. Wouldn't be as robust as the aluminium one but I'd like to hope it's not going to need to stand up to too much abuse...
</I>
Well, in a spirit of unmitigated generosity I will pay for a metal case!

&gt;<i> For space contributing some of the cost: I think £33.75 each is cheap enough to not bother with the minefield of &quot;Should we be spending collective money on something only a subset want?&quot; to reduce it. But on the other hand I'm happy to pay less if someone else wants to do the arguing that the space should fund some of it.
</I>
No, I don't thinki the space should fund something like this that only a 
few of us are actually interested in.

Let me know how much the case is and I'll send you the money.

Thanks for organising this!

   Tony.
