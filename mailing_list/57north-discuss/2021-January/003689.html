Hi folks. On this, I have been tinkering with an idea since the 12th
but it's still not very well formed. Feel free to skip to the end for
the quick summary.

Basically it involves some recurring virtual event that emphasises the
swapping of that typical 'sea of faces' webcam experience with a
collection of voiced, top-down webcam views of desk-size 'stuff' being
made/repaired/torn down etc.

Thinking about what I spent time in the space enjoying the most, I'd
have to say it was (1) working on kits and item repairs in 'claimed'
desk space whilst (2) listening to the music playlist selections of
others and (3) chatting randomly to folk sat working on things in
their own desk space. At some point, one person would glance at the
other's workspace goings-on and share interesting observations and/or
ask interesting questions.

Mumbling [1] along whilst listening to a SyncTube playlist that
Mumblers have contributed to actually covers a lot of that already,
and I am wondering if we can add something else to that comfortable
recipe which brings the 'shared workspace' dynamic we get in the
physical realm. I don't really enjoy webcams of talking heads - for
one I do it all day at work :'( and in this context it just doesn't
feel very hackerspace'ish. Switch that face view for a top-down
limited workspace view big-clive style [2] (i.e. no face, keyboard or
screen visible) and it becomes less intrusive in my mind, or at least
something different. Folk can arrive in the session with just Mumble
or can opt to load a VC tool (with audio off) that we can agree works
for this type of thing.

It turns out I have a large neglected list of desk-size items that I
want to repair rather than trash (go green!) and I also have a pile of
8odd Metal Earth kits to make up and enhance with tiny DIY lighting
rigs. Do other folk have similar micro-projects they enjoy and can do
at home BUT have trouble starting? Tooling might be the issue o/c, so
the things-being-done would have to be scaled to what in-house tools
can cope with. I also wonder if people can easily make home rigs to
hold webcams over desks? That might be quite a faff to make.

TL;DR: In a nutshell, would there be take-up for a Mumble + SyncTube +
a deskcam formula applied to a new build/repair/teardown focussed
weekly event? (not Tuesday). Of course it would need a catchy name
else it is clearly doomed to fail.

Cheers,
Nordin.
