That's 4 of us said we're willing to contribute to it - would be ~£33.75 each. If you're all OK with that I'll order it. 

For case: I like the plan of printing one ourselves. Wouldn't be as robust as the aluminium one but I'd like to hope it's not going to need to stand up to too much abuse... 

For space contributing some of the cost: I think £33.75 each is cheap enough to not bother with the minefield of &quot;Should we be spending collective money on something only a subset want?&quot; to reduce it. But on the other hand I'm happy to pay less if someone else wants to do the arguing that the space should fund some of it.
