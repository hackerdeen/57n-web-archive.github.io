<PRE>Morning all ðŸ˜€

It's Tuesday again, so open evening at 57 North Hackspace.

Come on along to hack n chat, all welcome, as usual.  If you're new, bring
a laptop, something to tinker with, or just yourself.  If you're coming in,
feel free to reply and tell us all what you're planning to do!  We're
located downstairs from Engage Gaming. Access is through our door just
beside the Assembly on Skene Terrace! If you're unsure about anything, ask
on email, IRC, facebook or twitter.

Looking forward to hearing about the Code the City at the weekend, sounds
like it was a good one.  More info on the Air Quality Monitora can be found
at <A HREF="https://wiki.57north.org.uk/index.php/Projects:Air_Quality_Monitor">https://wiki.57north.org.uk/index.php/Projects:Air_Quality_Monitor</A>

As an aside, if anyone has any STEM type project ideas, jot em on the wiki
page at <A HREF="https://wiki.57north.org.uk/index.php/STEM_project_ideas">https://wiki.57north.org.uk/index.php/STEM_project_ideas</A>

See you later ðŸ˜Ž
