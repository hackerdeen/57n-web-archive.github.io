</I>&gt;<i> You should make your way in to 57N tonight to talk about tech and play with toys!

</I>&gt;<i> If you've not heard of us, we get up to a range of activities on
</I>&gt;<i> Tuesday nights, including but not limited to social contact,
</I>&gt;<i> programming, manufacturing weird things and consuming sugary treats.
</I>&gt;<i> We usually begin at about 7, but sometimes someone will be in earlier. 
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> We're located downstairs from Engage Gaming. Access is through our
</I>&gt;<i> door just beside the Assembly on Skene Terrace! If you're unsure about
</I>&gt;<i> anything, ask in IRC[1]. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you're new, I'd suggest you bring a laptop, and perhaps a project
</I>&gt;<i> you want to work on.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you're coming in, feel free to reply and tell us all what you're
</I>&gt;<i> planning to do!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There's lots happening tonight! Come on down and get involved :) I'm
</I>&gt;<i> expecting the science centre crew to come and say hi to talk about
</I>&gt;<i> building something cool for their Easter holidays display!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Ongoing, we're still probably setting up a laser cutter, i'm still
</I>&gt;<i> probably setting up a barcode-scanenr powered honesty bar, there will
</I>&gt;<i> be the final preparations for the Air Quality monitoring Code the City
</I>&gt;<i> this weekend that we're doing in partnership with the open data
</I>&gt;<i> institute team [2]. There's a few other personal projects happening
</I>&gt;<i> too - I saw some wood being cut in the dirty workshop not too long
</I>&gt;<i> ago!
</I>
I think I will be in.
