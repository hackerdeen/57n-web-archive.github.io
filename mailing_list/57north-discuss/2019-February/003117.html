<PRE>Hi,

&gt;&gt;<i> I decided we should discuss this rather than me just changing it - whoever wrote it[0] obviously thought it was fine, I strongly disagree; so we should discuss it to see if there is a way to settle that disagreement.
</I>It is a wiki. Please change it as you wish. Your changes will be
recorded in the history.

Perhaps &quot;for-profit&quot; is the wrong term to use here, but it is not being
run for the benefit of the local community to my understanding.

If we just wanted a list of organizations that share geography then
fine, but if we want a list of organizations that also share philosophy
then I do not believe they belong here. Others may disagree.

Thanks,
Iain.
</PRE>
