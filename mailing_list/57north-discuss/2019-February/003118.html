<PRE>Hiya

Yea, it's a tricky one, I did think twice before adding it in there.
I'd been meaning to go to one of their MeetUps, just to get a feel for
the thing, but not managed so far.  On the plus side, they happen in a
pub, on the negative side, they sounds quite corporate. 7th of March
is the next one, I'll try get along.
<A HREF="https://ti.to/codebase-edinburgh/one-codebase-meetup-5/">https://ti.to/codebase-edinburgh/one-codebase-meetup-5/</A>

I'd stuck at the top...
&quot;organisations that share a common geography, space and/or philosophy&quot;
...but that is clear as mud really.  My thinking, with the page, was
that it might be the first step in bringing groups together to find
commonality.  Or, at least, as a less lofty goal be directory that
might occasionally be useful to our members.

So, anyway, it's not gonna save the world, but it might be slightly
useful sometimes :)

Thanks for the feedback and edits.

Cheers
Andy
