Hi, Tom.

I'm not going into Space this evening and I'll be off to England on
19th. Good news is that Adapteva have given me an RMA for my other three
Parallella boards and are going to return my SD card too ;-)

I've been in touch with Samtec about 'e-Link' cables for the Parallella
and discovered that Adapteva have already paid to have a custom cable
made. Unfortunately, these are the cables that break the connectors off
the boards(!). Samtec are willing to redesign a more flexible cable for
me, but the cost would be far too much unless I can persuade many other
Parallella cluster owners to buy them or I'll have to crowd-fund it!

Bye,

  Tony.
