A case should be made to the public about what is going on. This group
can be the light in the darkness when it comes to such matters.

Last thing that we should be doing (I know it was a joke but...) is
going into hiding. One of the target-painting methods in modern day
witch-hunt is conveying a person or a group as dark, illicit and
threatening to the masses. Media is pretty good at using terminology &amp;
technologies the public won't understand, ominous music, selective
association with the unethical uses of systems. You know the drill.

If the group is to do something, it should be transparent &amp; open and
educate the public. This is more serious than it looks, if they are to
keep pushing with changes to the civic system. UK has managed to become
one of the worst countries in matters of informational liberty in the
advanced world.
