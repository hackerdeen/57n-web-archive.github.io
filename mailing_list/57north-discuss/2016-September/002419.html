<PRE>Hiya

We have a shed that we're getting rid of, if anyone would like one.  Was a
bit of chat on Tuesday about this, but thought I'd better shout out
properly.

It is 210cm long, 152 cm wide and 215cm tall, as outside dimensions.

You can see some photos of it at...

<A HREF="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ip29r380wh378rq/AACHTwi4SuYxcuo398_Tqr1ta?dl=0">https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ip29r380wh378rq/AACHTwi4SuYxcuo398_Tqr1ta?dl=0</A>

Some notes about the shed...

   - It is pretty good quality, though not very new.
   - The roof felt is, I think, newer than the shed and in a good state.
   - The putty on the window is shot, and so some parts of the window frame
   have rotten a little
   - I was planning on replacing the two glass window panes with a piece of
   acrylic, which I bought and you're welcome to have too, if you would like
   to do this.
   - The main panels appear to be bolted together, so it should, hopefully,
   come apart ok.  It may be that to re-assemble it you'll need new bolts, I'd
   guess they are M6 size, so quite easy to find.
   - We're just getting rid of it due to our garden being smaller, so we
   got a smaller shed to replace this, to make more room.

If you want it...

   - You'll have to come and pick it up.
   - I can help you dismantle it, bring it through the house and load your
   vehicle.  This might take an hour or two.
   - At a total guess, I'd say it is maybe 100kg in total, but it should
   disassemble into six or seven large parts.
   - I'd guess the largest part is probably 210 x 180cm so you'd probably
   need to have a big car, a trailer, large roof-rack or a van.  I guess you
   could maybe take it on the bus.  For van hire UHire

   <A HREF="https://www.hertz247.co.uk/bq/en-gb/Home">https://www.hertz247.co.uk/bq/en-gb/Home</A> do cheap-ish rates.
   - We're just on the south west corner of the ARI, just off Westburn Road.
   - You'll have to come and get it next week really, we need to get shot
   of it quite sharpish.
   - Most anytime is fine, day or evening.

I've not put it on Gumtree or Freecycle yet, but I'll maybe do that if
no-one from the space wants it.

Let me know.

Cheers

Andy
