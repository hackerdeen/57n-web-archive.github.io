I will be in, I will be seeing how well my system does trying to win
this bet with Nordin. I'll probably be asking people where is best to
set up a mqtt broker too. 

To Kickstart: 
	We probably want to run one on a vps and maybe federate to one in
	the space. We can firewall off topics so space only messages can
	stay within the building. How does that sound?

	We might actually want an even more complicated architecture so we
	can use mqtt over websockets and embed stuff in webpages.

	SSL is also a consideration, but writing against the api has been
	making me sad all week.

&gt;<i> I won't be in as I'm curling,  but I'll be there in spirit or something.

Booo, hiss!
