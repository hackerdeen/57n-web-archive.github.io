<PRE>Suggest we move this discussion to the aberdeen-crypto list to include
the non-hacklab people too.

We do plan to run more Cryptoparties where each one would be focused on
a particular topic. They will still all be followed by interactive
freestyle workshops where volunteers with knowledge would be able to
assist people with any problems they have and help them with security tools.

&gt;<i> As regards your accounts, it is possible that some may have locked as a
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;security feature&quot; as they noticed logins from outside your normal
</I>&gt;<i> geographic location - this is because the Tor exit node could be anywhere
</I>&gt;<i> in the world &amp; a far as yahoo / eBay  is concerned, your access is coming
</I>&gt;<i> from the exit node - Im assuming they have (rightly) assumed you're not in
</I>&gt;<i> that location &amp; may have warned / emailed you as a result.  There may be
</I>&gt;<i> options to disable the warnings / set certain behaviour limits with your
</I>&gt;<i> accounts, however I will be the first to say I haven't used either of those
</I>&gt;<i> services over Tor myself.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Beyond that, I'm happy to say that I'm not a Tor expert, but I am
</I>&gt;<i> interested in learning more myself &amp; would be happy to sit down, go over
</I>&gt;<i> the issues you've experienced &amp; see if we can research / identify a cause
</I>&gt;<i> together.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
I'd like to get some tools documented on the Wiki[1], possibly with the
aim of producing a free e-book that explains to people how to set up the
tools and how to troubleshoot common issues when they arise.

</I>&gt;<i> tenants,looks unused ,if you want it and a spare hub.
</I>&gt;<i> Best of all would be a couple of sessions on basics about whats under the
</I>&gt;<i> system.I generally fix stuff by elimination but there is so much more I
