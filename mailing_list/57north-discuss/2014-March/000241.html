<PRE>Note: It is pancake day, everyone that wishes can bring pancakes. Make sure there is enough for the class.

Hello all,

Again it is Tuesday 57 North&#8217;s weekly open night. Each Tuesday the members get together, drink too much, talk shit and sometimes even work on projects. Open nights are open to anyone that wants to come along. 

Members that are planning on coming in and working on something should reply to this so everyone has an idea of what is going on. 

Tonight I will be looking at PS2 communication with an arduino, maybe even programming some AVR&#8217;s.


Events Coming Up:

Thursday 6th of March 2014:
	Board Game night: 	Do you like games? Does cardboard get you wild? Then you will love board game night. This 						Thursday there will be a board game night, starting from 1900 and going til late. More info in the
					wiki  or contact Tom(<A HREF="http://lists.57north.co/listinfo/57north-discuss">tom at 57north.co</A>) for more details.	
Saturday 15th or March 2014:
	MakeIt-Glo Workshop:	MakeIt-Glo is an introductory electronics workshop for all ages. In this workshop you will build
						a digispark (arduino like board) based RGB lamp. It costs &#163;12, but the parts alone will make
						the workshop worth it. Coupled with our ideas and tuition you can take the lamp to the moon.
