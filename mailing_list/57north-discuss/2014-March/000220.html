<PRE>Evening all,

Now I have returned from the wilds of Norfolk, we are back on track for the full size rack project. If no one knows of a suitable rack, one will have to be acquired and brought to the space. I'd be keen to get this on the go so its in place by the next time I'm going away. Has anyone found such a rack in Aberdeen?

Once we have a rack, we will need to outfit it. Has anyone worked out how many working systems we have for the cluster? If we aim for about 12 working systems, with 3 switches, we would need around 24 power lines to accommodate the other stuff as well, so we are looking at proper PDUs and a separate power line for the rack. We will need an idea of how much power is being drawn from everything that goes in the rack, and for it to balanced out and managed across the different PDUs.

Tl,dr: have we got a rack, and how much is going in it? 

Cheers
Calum
