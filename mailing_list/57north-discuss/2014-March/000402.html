Because HTTPS isn't currently configured, I need to find time to do that
and so far don't have any. It doesn't make sense to send people to a URL
that doesn't resolve.

&gt;<i> I spy Makes website said somethign about being the first. Why is it such a

Make is the first Digital Fabrication Lab. Being Aberdeen's First
Hackerspace has always been a part of our brand, even back when we were
Hackerdeen, even if it's not entirely accurate.

&gt;<i> I don't like the actual paragraph tryign to say what it is. To much hack..
</I>
We're a hackerspace...

&gt;<i> I must have totally missed the email that put this out for review.
</I>
There wasn't one, it's a poster, rule 1. We can always evolve it and
I'll be adding the IRC channel to it.

The PSD is over 100MB, so I can't really put it anywhere, but can bring
it into the space and upload it to whiteboard over the wifi and then
people can download it over the wifi.

Iain.
