Please reply with Ian Watt CC'd, I don't believe he's on the list.

Subject: Open Data ecosystem in Aberdeen? What can 57 North do to
support this?

To: '<A HREF="http://lists.57north.co/listinfo/57north-discuss">contact at 57north.co</A>' &lt;<A HREF="http://lists.57north.co/listinfo/57north-discuss">contact at 57north.co</A>&gt;

Hi,

I'd hoped that someone from 57 North would have been at the National
Hack The Government Day at RGU at the weekend. I was there Saturday and
Sunday but while there were lots of attendees for the Global Service Jam
there were no hackers unfortunately.

I'd like to talk to a representative of your group around which of you
members would be interested in hacking Open Data.

We've run several hacks in the last few years - including last year's
culture hack - and my team's efforts meant that we were the first
Scottish Local Authority to release Open Data.

We're now signed up to Code for Europe which is a massive step for
Aberdeen as a city - and a significant  investment in terms of finance
as well as time from ACC staff.

You can read more here on my personal blog:
<A HREF="http://10ml.com/2014/03/code-for-europe-comes-to-aberdeen-via-barcelona/">http://10ml.com/2014/03/code-for-europe-comes-to-aberdeen-via-barcelona/</A>
 (plus the follow up article)

Please feel free to circulate this to interested members.

I'd be happy to come along on Tuesday 18th in the evening to speak to
your group if there will be members there with interests in this area.
If you could encourage members with an interest in opendata-based app
development that would be great.

My aim is to first map out, then grow the Open Data ecosystem in
Aberdeen through engagement, events, data releases and cross-working
between institutions, informal groups and other bodies. It appears that
the local linkages across sectors are not well developed yet,
particularly compared to Amsterdam or Helsinki (with whom we will be
working on this programme).

I hope that we can collaborate on this!

Thanks

Ian
