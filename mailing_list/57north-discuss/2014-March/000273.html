<PRE>hi,
I am Mojca and came to the first crypto session...........spent the next
week paranoid.Installed tor but after re-booting it won't work the next
day.Also started reading the source code files and well,wish I KNEW
MORE.my E-BAY ACCOUNT as well as my yahoo account will not recognize my log
in even after getting a new code ect.Yahoo informed me my PC was accessed
?EH? Same with yahoo mail.Is there any chance you guys could run a few
workshops on how to understand the information and how to read the
logs?Just a couple of sessions and a pointer to the right books,websites?
I also have a couple of laptops plus a tower,I was wondering if you might
like them,the tower is only 8 months old but went dead,the laptops have
problems.I would really like to have a laptop if you could fix one and you
can keep the others?There is also a printer in the loft from the last
tenants,looks unused ,if you want it and a spare hub.
Best of all would be a couple of sessions on basics about whats under the
system.I generally fix stuff by elimination but there is so much more I
don't know.Maybe the space could help me and any others catch up?
