<PRE>Hi Mojca,

I ran the Tor talk &amp; would be happy to go over things, though this week is
rather busy, as I'm running a Locksport / lock picking workshop on Thursday
evening (feel free to pop in if interested)

As regards your accounts, it is possible that some may have locked as a
&quot;security feature&quot; as they noticed logins from outside your normal
geographic location - this is because the Tor exit node could be anywhere
in the world &amp; a far as yahoo / eBay  is concerned, your access is coming
from the exit node - Im assuming they have (rightly) assumed you're not in
that location &amp; may have warned / emailed you as a result.  There may be
options to disable the warnings / set certain behaviour limits with your
accounts, however I will be the first to say I haven't used either of those
services over Tor myself.

Beyond that, I'm happy to say that I'm not a Tor expert, but I am
interested in learning more myself &amp; would be happy to sit down, go over
the issues you've experienced &amp; see if we can research / identify a cause
together.

Regarding the other machines etc, would be best to get details of the
machines in question, but in principal anything that is working &amp; not
really old is likely to be of use.

However (personal opinion, others may disagree) I would usually recommend
against donations that are known to be faulty, unless a specific member has
a project in mind or is volunteering to assess / fix the machines in
question (feel free to volunteer folks!) as otherwise it is likely to
remain unfixed, as many of us are already juggling many exuding projects!

Regards
Tony

hi,
I am Mojca and came to the first crypto session...........spent the next
week paranoid.Installed tor but after re-booting it won't work the next
day.Also started reading the source code files and well,wish I KNEW
MORE.my E-BAY ACCOUNT as well as my yahoo account will not recognize my log
in even after getting a new code ect.Yahoo informed me my PC was accessed
?EH? Same with yahoo mail.Is there any chance you guys could run a few
workshops on how to understand the information and how to read the
logs?Just a couple of sessions and a pointer to the right books,websites?
I also have a couple of laptops plus a tower,I was wondering if you might
like them,the tower is only 8 months old but went dead,the laptops have
problems.I would really like to have a laptop if you could fix one and you
can keep the others?There is also a printer in the loft from the last
tenants,looks unused ,if you want it and a spare hub.
Best of all would be a couple of sessions on basics about whats under the
system.I generally fix stuff by elimination but there is so much more I
don't know.Maybe the space could help me and any others catch up?
