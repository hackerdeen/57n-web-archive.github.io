It's office space, people typically aren't going window shopping. That
guy tried to break into everything. Hiding valuables isn't realistic and
it wouldn't have prevented what happened.

</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> We would have to be careful with this. They can be a good option, but they have to fail open. If they fail shut, then we may have problems getting in or out, especially if we install one on the other door. If doorbot falls over, then we would need them to open the door, which eliminates the point of having them. We would have to take an 8lb key to the door to get in. 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
It would be a supplement to the existing lock, and that lock does fail
safe. The lock on the main door is quite sufficient. I don't think we
need a deadbolt there too.

</I>&gt;<i> This one is in china, could be a while to get it.
</I>
It's not urgent. We can use Ed's manual bolt and the original lock until
it arrives. It's meant to supplement the existing security.
