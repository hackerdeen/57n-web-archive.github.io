<PRE>Hi All,

Today I am posting about IDM. For those that don't know what IDM is, it
emerged in the early 90s drawing from EDM in the UK and Japan at the time.
It is not a solidly defined genre, and tends to include a lot of
experimentation. Tracks can tend to be radically different and at times not
make any sense at all.

Some IDM has the speed of hardcore but also feels ambient. I find it's
great for coding, especially at 5am.

A couple of tracks to introduce you:

  <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyxJ_16EaoM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyxJ_16EaoM</A>
  <A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytEq0OGIXek">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytEq0OGIXek</A>

In August 1993, a mailing list was created for discussing IDM. Originally
for the discussion of music relating to Aphex Twin and Warp's early
&quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot; compilations. Since that time, both the list and
the range of music that is discussed on it have grown considerably. It has
over 1600 people subscribed to it according to the website.

  <A HREF="http://music.hyperreal.org/lists/idm/">http://music.hyperreal.org/lists/idm/</A>

While I did subscribe to the list, it doesn't appear to be active anymore,
as I haven't had any messages from it in quite a while.

If this is something that you feel you would be interested in, you can dive
in futher with these links:

Enjoy. (:

Iain.
