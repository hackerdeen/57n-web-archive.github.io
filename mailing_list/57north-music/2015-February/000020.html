<PRE>I lurk on this list as I'm quite musically illiterate / tasteless  -
there should be a word for that - and usually always appreciate Hibby's
new music recommendations. However i'm not vibing so well on this stuff,
it all sounds a bit like advertorial support music, a bit soul-free. I
keep expecting an enthusiastic voiceover to kick in, promoting some
aspirational lifestyle product. It feels like it has been too explicitly
made to sell. I shall hope for better luck next random Monday :) 

&gt;<i> Post rock act Lights &amp; Motion has been on the go for a wee whiley,
</I>&gt;<i> previously named Aerials. 
</I>&gt;<i> It sounds a bit like Sigur Ros * Explosions in the sky * M83 with a bit
</I>&gt;<i> of Hans Zimmer, it's pretty great.
