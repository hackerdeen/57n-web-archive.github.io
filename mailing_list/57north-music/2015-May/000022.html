<PRE>This list has been quiet for a while so I thought I would let you know
about some stuff coming up in Aberdeen that I'm looking forward to and
I thought some of you might like too...

Firstly we have The Revellers at Moorings on the 12th of June[0]. The
poster [2] has the best  blurb for them I've seen: &quot;Fiddle and banjo
melodies, heavy rock middle section, fast and furious playing and
flamboyant stage antics.&quot;

Then on Saturday 13th Moorings has Electric Eel Shock[3]. Japanese
rock band that are highly entertaining. They have previously come
close to living up to Moorings' &quot;Live Nude Bands&quot; sign.

Looking further into the future Hayseed Dixie are coming to the Lemon
Tree in October [4]. Hayseed Dixie are kind of bluegrass meets rock
with a mix of covers and original stuff. A play through [5] ought to
give you a pretty good idea if you haven't come across them before. 

Finally, I've just come across Lindsey Stirling's dubstep violin [6]
and am liking it a lot.

Apologies for facebook links, but that seems to be where most of the
information is (the moorings own website [1] is hilarious but not very
useful (the gig listings are from 2009)).
