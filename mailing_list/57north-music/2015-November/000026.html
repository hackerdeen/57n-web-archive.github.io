I'm more than happy to talk at you (or anyone else who might listen
(or be too polite to actually tell me to shut up)) about music.

'Tis the season when bands have gotten over the festival season and
are again touring so my current listening is dominated by bands I'm
going to see in the near future or recent past:

Godspeed You! Black Emperor: apparently this is chamber rock. 

Every Time I Die: Kind of punk, playing in Aberdeen on Friday (and
probably elsewhere near here before/after that).

Epica: Melodic/orchestral metal, playing in Glasgow on Saturday
(support for this is Scar Symmetry and Eluveitie who are also both
worth a listen).

Idlewild: Ye Olde indie rock, but with a new album this year and
actually touring again.

Apocalyptica: metal + cellos; they do a mix of original stuff and
covers. 

Rolo Tomassi: match rock (with various forays towards other genres)
group that happen to be going to be in Prague at the same time as I am
next month.
