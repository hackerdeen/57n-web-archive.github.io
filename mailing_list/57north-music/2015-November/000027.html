<PRE>This is great thank you. I'm enjoying Godspeed You! Black Emperor. Not
my usual kind of thing, I default to the techno standards of my youth.
I've been getting the wee man into the KLF, and can't quite take in that
it was all recorded so long ago. ditto The Shamen  (didn't realise they
were from Aberdeen too) but I've overlistened all of that now.

I gave Darth Elvis and the Imperials a try on Youtube and they look
wonderful but I find it hard to listen to recorded live music, prefer
produced music...

Thanks!
