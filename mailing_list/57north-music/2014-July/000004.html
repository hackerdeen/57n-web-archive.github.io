<PRE>Are you familiar with electro swing? If you're not, you should be! It's
the latest and greatest thing (it's not new, but it is pretty groovy).

The base concept is to sample swing, jazz and other classy-as-hell music
from the olden days to make new, groovy electronic music. For the most
part, it sounds really, really good. There's something about the way it
bounces along that I find totally irresistable.

Artists to look out for are Caravan Palace, Goldfish and Parov Stelar.

Have some examples:

Catgroove: The classic Parov Stelar tune with some mental guy dancing to
it in his eastern European living room. I wish I could move like him:

Clap Your Hands is the latest Parov Stelar production, it's more swing
than electro and it sounds funky fresh, yo:

Caravan Palace are a french lot - they sound pretty significantly
different to Parov Stelar &amp; his band. There's a very classic
French/Parisian sound in everything they do, unfortunately, but it still
bounces along sounding as classy as a good gin and tonic. It's just that
muted trumpet and strumming of something sound, it's great.

Jolie Coquine:

Dramophone (more dancing people I envy):

Goldfish are more electro than swing, and occasionally they pull in some
excellent sounds from their Native South Africa - they do lots and lots
of good stuff, but for the purposes of here:

We Come Together (this video is beautifully 8bit inspired):

Woman's A Devil:
<A HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF5ea9nU1N8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF5ea9nU1N8</A>


Go, explore, learn and share! If I've missed anything obvious and you're
an expert or not, correct me. If you're heard something great, share it.
I always want more!
